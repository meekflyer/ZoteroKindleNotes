For the purposes of this book, we think it’s best to keep it simple. At its essence, cyberspace is the realm of computer networks (and the users behind them) in which information is stored, shared, and communicated online. But rather than trying to find the exact perfectly worded definition of cyberspace, it is more useful to unpack what these definitions are trying to get at.

Cyberspace is first and foremost an information environment. It is made up of digitized data that is created, stored, and, most importantly, shared. This means that it is not merely a physical place and thus defies measurement in any kind of physical dimension. But cyberspace isn’t purely virtual. It comprises the computers that store data plus the systems and infrastructure that allow it to flow. This includes the Internet of networked computers, closed intranets, cellular technologies, fiber-optic cables, and space-based communications.

In its latest attempt in 2008, the Pentagon assembled a team of experts who took over a year to agree on yet another definition of cyberspace. This time they termed it “the global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.” It is certainly a more detailed definition but so dense that one almost wishes we could go back to just the “tubes.”

This leads to an important point often misunderstood. Cyberspace may be global, but it is not “stateless” or a “global commons,” both terms frequently used in government and media. Just as we humans have artificially divided our globe into territories that we call “nations” and, in turn, our human species into various groups like “nationalities,” the same can be done with cyberspace. It relies on physical infrastructure and human users who are tied to geography, and thus is also subject to our human notions like sovereignty, nationality, and property. Or, to put it another way, cyberspace’s divisions are as real as the meaningful, but also imaginary, lines that divide the United States from Canada or North from South Carolina.

Electronic communication networks have been shaping how we share information since the invention of the telegraph, the device that some now look back on and call the “Victorian Internet.” The hype around that old technology were similarly high; contemporaries declared that, with the telegraph, “It is impossible that old prejudices and hostilities should longer exist.”

What makes the Internet distinct from prior communication networks like the old telegraphs and then telephone networks, however, is that it is packet-switched instead of circuit-switched. Packets are small digital envelopes of data. At the beginning of each packet, essentially the “outside” of the envelope, is the header, which contains details about the network source, destination, and some basic information about the packet contents. By breaking up flows of data into smaller components, each can be delivered in an independent and decentralized fashion, then reassembled at the endpoint. The network routes each packet as it arrives, a dynamic architecture that creates both flexibility and resiliency.

Packet-switching was not developed to allow the United States to maintain communications even in the event of a nuclear attack, a common myth. It was really just developed to better enable more reliable, more efficient connections between computers. Prior to its rise in the 1970s, communication between two computers required a dedicated circuit, or preassigned bandwidth. This direct link meant those resources could not be used by anyone else, even when no data was being transmitted. By breaking these conversations into smaller parts, packets from multiple distinct conversations could share the same network links. It also meant that if one of the network links between two machines went down mid-communication, a transmission could be automatically rerouted with no apparent loss of connection (since there was never a connection to begin with).

As people shared machines for research, they started leaving messages for each other, simple files that could be edited to form a conversation. This became clunky, and in 1972 Ray Tomlinson at the technical consulting firm BBN wrote a basic program to read, compose, and send messages. This was e-mail: the first Internet “killer app.” Within a year, a majority of traffic across the network originally created for research was e-mail. Now networked communication was about people.

If this sounds complex, it’s because it is! In just a few pages, we’ve summed up what it took decades of computer science research to create. The takeaway for cybersecurity is that the entire system is based on trust. It is a system that works efficiently, but it can be broken, either by accident or by maliciously feeding the system bad data.

Beyond this classic CIA triangle of security, we believe it is important to add another property: resilience. Resilience is what allows a system to endure security threats instead of critically failing. A key to resilience is accepting the inevitability of threats and even limited failures in your defenses. It is about remaining operational with the understanding that attacks and incidents happen on a continuous basis. Here again, there is a parallel to the human body. Your body still figures out a way to continue functioning even if your external layer of defense—your skin—is penetrated by a cut or even bypassed by an attack like a viral infection. Just as in the body, in the event of a cyber incident, the objective should be to prioritize resources and operations, protect key assets and systems from attacks, and ultimately restore normal operations.

The good news is that there are only three things you can do to a computer: steal its data, misuse credentials, and hijack resources. Unfortunately, our dependence on information systems means that a skilled actor could wreak a lot of damage by doing any one of those. Stolen data can reveal the strategic plans of a country or undermine the competitiveness of an entire industry. Stolen credentials can give the ability to change or destroy code and data, changing payrolls or opening up dams, as well as the ability to cover tracks. Hijacking resources can prevent a company from reaching customers or deny an army the ability to communicate.

Ways to Build Powerful Relationships as a FAO ​My advice on how to make yourself impactful and how to luck-into useful interactions follows. ​Food is a weapon of peace. ​Trust, but verify of course -- but know that FAO work is all about establishing and maintaining trust.  You can do little without it and you might even change stubborn international policy with it. ​Listen to and watch your host-nation partners.  What do they repeat?  What do they avoid talking about?  Who do they complain about?  All of these are indicators of how to build trust.  Again, be smart.  Do not get sucked into any local feuds which normally only end up harming the mission.  Do not just listen to the official topics; ask questions and let them tell stories of importance to them.  They are saying more than you think.[6]  ​Self-study and culture, culture, culture…You can avoid a lot of pitfalls by getting your head around their culture.  Be a sponge.  Read constantly.  Talk to everyone you can in every job or position.  You cannot learn too much; it does not mean you have “gone local,” it means you have become useful. ​Build a diverse network and collaborate well[7].  Help others as much as you can, and if you must, guilt them into helping you, but this is usually not necessary.  Do not just build teams in-country; build a robust “reach-back” team.  For defense cooperation or Security Force Assistance reach-back teams might include the U.S. Military Academy, Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the Intelligence agencies, any of the policy officers at OSD and the Joint Staff, the NSC staff, State Department bureaus, Congress, and higher combatant commands like CENTCOM.  You might even be faced with a chance to bring a very junior person onto your team, like a MG choosing a 1LT as his ADC!  Stranger things have happened and worked. ​You are never off duty and every day offers a chance to prove yourself and earn their trust.  The Buzkashi match offers a great example of the randomness of this work – and that opportunity may lie where you least expect.  There are lots of ways to build trust so be creative and take chances.  Note: Try not to get killed in the process (i.e., by 14-year-old guards with poor muzzle discipline). ​Select great host-nation employees and then take care of them.  Keep them and their family safe and reward them on evaluations and with bonuses if available.  Do not forget to farewell them correctly and introduce them to their next team so that trust is not lost. Do not forget to rest your mind occasionally to avoid saying anything that can damage relationships.  Remember that your host-nation partners might be tired too.  Leisure time and alone time are also critical to success. ​Understand the problems of your partners and advise them honestly in private.  Keep their secrets so they can trust you.  Not every issue is a D.C.-level topic -- solve local problems locally.[8] ​Be flexible and not risk averse.  Your security precautions will tell your partners a lot about you.  There are times to be overtly safe and times to do it in a low-key manner.  Travel and live like the locals when it is advisable, but do not be too crazy. ​Treat everyone equally and return hospitality like it is a competition.  You never know who is going to be important during your tour or in the future.

By Colonel Stephen R. Norton, USA Retired Editor: Colonel Peter Podbielski, USA Retired ​Culture Shock isn’t limited to serving in foreign countries.  I experienced more culture shock working in the Pentagon than I did in my first posting in Turkey.  The difference in philosophy, temperament, viewpoint, etc., between the military and political leadership in the Department of Defense was eye opening.  The same can be said for cultural differences between the Defense Attaché Service and the Foreign Service. ​Serving on the Joint Staff was an exhilarating experience, one that I would not have traded for anything.  It was also grueling, fast-paced and exhausting.  I was the Country Director for Greece, Turkey, Cyprus and Malta in the JCS Directorate for Strategic Plans and Policy in the mid-1980s, at a time when the mercurial, anti-American, anti-Turkish Andreas Papandreou was Greece’s Prime Minister.  The Greek terrorist organization, known as 17 November, stepped up attacks on U.S. military and civilian personnel stationed in Greece during Papandreou’s term in office, yet he made no meaningful attempts to neutralize this group.  While the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to maintain a relationship with the Greek military, it was becoming harder every day as Papandreou forced his anti-American biases into the military sphere.  He refused to participate in NATO exercises in the eastern Mediterranean and Aegean Sea and even cancelled very small, low-profile training with U.S. Special Forces.  The question for the Joint Chiefs of Staff was, should the U.S. military leave Greece completely?  On the political side in the Pentagon, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, Richard Perle, was as anti-Greek as Papandreou was anti-American.  Perle was also a strident supporter of Turkey and often touted its greater strategic importance to the U.S. compared with that of Greece.  His staff made it clear to me that U.S. missions being conducted in Greece could move to Turkey.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Vessey, knew the right answer was to keep U.S. forces in Greece and ride out the Papandreou government.  General Vessey said if we leave Greece, it would be unlikely we could ever return in the future even with a more pro-American government in Athens.  His task to me was to draft a plan to keep U.S. forces in Greece and get the four military services, the European Command and the Department of State to agree.  He would handle whatever opposition would come from Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger or Assistant Secretary Perle.

Ankara was my first diplomatic assignment and early on I learned a valuable lesson from the U.S. Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) Richard Boehm.  He told me as a diplomat and intelligence officer, every foreign official I had contact with could, and probably would, file a biographical report on me to their respective intelligence service.  I’ve always remembered this advice.  In countless meetings with Greeks and Turks both in Ankara and Washington, D.C., my intent was to come across as neither pro-Greek nor pro-Turkish but pro-American and as an honest broker.  By the time I arrived in Cyprus, I knew both the Greek and Turkish commanders had access to their respective biographic reports on me.   The majority of these reports would be from Greek and Turkish attaches, intelligence officers and diplomats.  Of course, I didn’t know what was said about me, but I hoped it was an accurate description.

​Access, credibility and influence with foreign contacts are the hallmark of a successful military attaché.  As a diplomatic representative of the U.S. Department of Defense, initial access with a contact is not difficult.  Maintaining access, however, is a different story.  For me to keep regular contact with the military commanders in Cyprus I had to be credible.  Knowing the history between Greeks and Turks from the year 1071 and the battle of Manzikurt to the present was important. Knowing how Turks viewed the rise and fall of the Ottoman Empire and how Greeks felt about the loss of the Byzantine Empire and the making of modern Greece was equally important.  Understanding the two cultures in Greece and Turkey allowed me to think like a Turk when I was with Lieutenant General Bitlis and ponder like a Greek when I was with Lieutenant General Markopoulos.  With credibility established you can then influence decisions.

​Treating people with respect always goes a long way.  At the first Republic of Cyprus National Day parade I attended, the Greek Cypriots put their newest military weapons on display.  The parade was organized by a Greek Cypriot colonel.  After the parade, which went very well, the UK Defence Attaché went up to the colonel and lectured him about wasting their money on such advanced weapons, which would only start an arms race with the Turks.  As I witnessed this, I could only think how inappropriate for a British officer to lecture a Cypriot officer over policies he has no responsibility for.  On the other hand, I congratulated the Cypriot colonel for organizing a superb parade and told him how impressive the soldiers looked.  My access to senior Greek Cypriot officers remained open while my British counterpart’s access was greatly curtailed.

From examining such human choices in market situations, Carl Menger, the father of the Austrian school of economics and founder of marginal analysis in economics, came up with an understanding of the key property that leads to a good being adopted freely as money on the market, and that is salability—the ease with which a good can be sold on the market whenever its holder desires, with the least loss in its price.2

A good that is salable across scales can be conveniently divided into smaller units or grouped into larger units, thus allowing the holder to sell it in whichever quantity he desires. Salability across space indicates an ease of transporting the good or carrying it along as a person travels, and this has led to good monetary media generally having high value per unit of weight. Both of these characteristics are not very hard to fulfill by a large number of goods that could potentially serve the function of money. It is the third element, salability across time, which is the most crucial. A good's salability across time refers to its ability to hold value into the future, allowing the holder to store wealth in it, which is the second function of money: store of value.

A common characteristic of forms of money throughout history is the presence of some mechanism to restrain the production of new units of the good to maintain the value of the existing units. The relative difficulty of producing new monetary units determines the hardness of money: money whose supply is hard to increase is known as hard money, while easy money is money whose supply is amenable to large increases.

A one-time collapse in the value of a monetary medium is tragic, but at least it is over quickly and its holders can begin trading, saving, and calculating with a new one. But a slow drain of its monetary value over time will slowly transfer the wealth of its holders to those who can produce the medium at a low cost.

Slowly but surely, Europeans were able to purchase a lot of the precious resources of Africa for the beads they acquired back home for very little.2 European incursion into Africa slowly turned beads from hard money to easy money, destroying their salability and causing the erosion of the purchasing power of these beads over time in the hands of the Africans who owned them, impoverishing them by transferring their wealth to the Europeans, who could acquire the beads easily. The aggry beads later came to be known as slave beads for the role they played in fueling the slave trade of Africans to Europeans and North Americans.

My understanding of America, stemming from my parents and 90’s pop culture of course, was that it was the land of freedom and equality, because it gave all the same rights to ALL of its citizens. ​I saw how people around the Middle East danced around certain topics and subjects, paranoia manifesting in every word they uttered. A combination of conservative cultural practices and authoritarian regimes, meant people were afraid to speak their minds for fear of reprisal, perceived or in many cases very real.

However, no matter who you are, or where you are from, which religion you practice, or don’t, there seems to be one constant: everyone thinks they’re right. Recognizing this reality alone, will increase your empathy. Give people the benefit of the doubt, and when they tell you who they are; listen without judgment. Do you want to genuinely bond with people? Find out what it is that they believe, and why. More importantly, ask yourself the same thing and be willing to share.

For anything to function as a good store of value, it has to beat this trap: it has to appreciate when people demand it as a store of value, but its producers have to be constrained from inflating the supply significantly enough to bring the price down. Such an asset will reward those who choose it as their store of value, increasing their wealth in the long run as it becomes the prime store of value, because those who chose other commodities will either reverse course by copying the choice of their more successful peers, or will simply lose their wealth.

The impossibility of synthesizing gold from other chemicals means that the only way to increase the supply of gold is by mining gold from the earth, an expensive, toxic, and uncertain process in which humans have been engaged for thousands of years with ever-diminishing returns. This all means that the existing stockpile of gold held by people around the world is the product of thousands of years of gold production, and is orders of magnitude larger than new annual production. Over the past seven decades with relatively reliable statistics, this growth rate has always been around 1.5%, never exceeding 2%. (See Figure 1.2)

Ferdinand Lips summarizes this process with a lesson to modern readers: It should be of interest to modern Keynesian economists, as well as to the present generation of investors, that although the emperors of Rome frantically tried to “manage” their economies, they only succeeded in making matters worse. Price and wage controls and legal tender laws were passed, but it was like trying to hold back the tides. Rioting, corruption, lawlessness and a mindless mania for speculation and gambling engulfed the empire like a plague. With money so unreliable and debased, speculation in commodities became far more attractive than producing them.6 The long-term consequences for the Roman Empire were devastating.

Even after it was debased and its empire fell, the bezant lived on by inspiring another form of sound money that continues to circulate widely to this day in spite of not being the official currency of any nation anymore, and that is the Islamic dinar. As Islam rose during the golden age of Byzantium, the bezant and coins similar to it in weight and size were circulating in the regions to which Islam had spread. The Umayyad Caliph Abdul-Malik ibn Marwan defined the weight and value of the Islamic dinar and imprinted it with the Islamic shahada creed in 697 AD. The Umayyad dynasty fell, and after it several other Islamic states, and yet the dinar continues to be held and to circulate widely in Islamic regions in the original weight and size specifications of the bezant, and is used in dowries, gifts, and various religious and traditional customs to this day. Unlike the Romans and the Byzantines, Arab and Muslim civilizations' collapse was not linked to the collapse of their money as they maintained the integrity of their currencies for centuries. The solidus, first minted by Diocletian in AD 301, has changed its name to the bezant and the Islamic dinar, but it continues to circulate today. Seventeen centuries of people the world over have used this coin for transactions, emphasizing the salability of gold across time.

While it is widely recognized that the rise of the city-states dragged Europe out of the Dark Ages and into the Renaissance, the role of sound money in this rise is less recognized. It was in the city-states that humans could live with the freedom to work, produce, trade, and flourish, and that was to a large extent the result of these city-states adopting a sound monetary standard. It all began in Florence in 1252, when the city minted the florin, the first major European sound coinage since Julius Caesar's aureus. Florence's rise made it the commercial center of Europe, with its florin becoming the prime European medium of exchange, allowing its banks to flourish across the entire continent. Venice was the first to follow Florence's example with its minting of the ducat, of the same specifications as the florin, in 1270, and by the end of the fourteenth century more than 150 European cities and states had minted coins of the same specifications as the florin, allowing their citizens the dignity and freedom to accumulate wealth and trade with a sound money that was highly salable across time and space, and divided into small coins, allowing for easy divisibility.

Britain would remain under a gold standard until 1914, although it would suspend it during the Napoleonic wars from 1797 to 1821. The economic supremacy of Britain was intricately linked to its being on a superior monetary standard, and other European countries began to follow it. The end of the Napoleonic wars heralded the beginning of the golden age of Europe, as, one by one, the major European nations began adopting the gold standard. The more nations officially adopted the gold standard, the more marketable gold became and the larger the incentive became for other nations to join.

La Belle Époque The end of the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, and the consequent shift of all major European powers onto the same monetary standard, namely gold, led to a period of prosperity and flourishing that continues to appear more amazing with time and in retrospect. A case can be made for the nineteenth century—in particular, the second half of it—being the greatest period for human flourishing, innovation, and achievement that the world had ever witnessed, and the monetary role of gold was pivotal to it. With silver and other media of exchange increasingly demonetized, the majority of the planet used the same golden monetary standard, allowing the improvements in telecommunications and transportation to foster global capital accumulation and trade like never before.

In the United States this era was called the Gilded Age, where economic growth boomed after the restoration of the gold standard in 1879 in the wake of the American Civil War. It was only interrupted by one episode of monetary insanity, which was effectively the last dying pang of silver as money, discussed in Chapter 6, when the Treasury tried to remonetize silver by mandating it as money. This caused a large increase in the money supply and a bank run by those seeking to sell Treasury notes and silver to gold. The result was the recession of 1893, after which U.S. economic growth resumed.

Gold being centralized made it vulnerable to having its monetary role usurped by its enemies, and gold simply had too many enemies, as Mises himself well understood: The nationalists are fighting the gold standard because they want to sever their countries from the world market and to establish national autarky as far as possible. Interventionist governments and pressure groups are fighting the gold standard because they consider it the most serious obstacle to their endeavours to manipulate prices and wage rates. But the most fanatical attacks against gold are made by those intent upon credit expansion. With them credit expansion is the panacea for all economic ills.

The oldest recorded example of fiat money was jiaozi, a paper currency issued by the Song dynasty in China in the tenth century. Initially, jiaozi was a receipt for gold or silver, but then government controlled its issuance and suspended redeemability, increasing the amount of currency printed until it collapsed. The Yuan dynasty also issued fiat currency in 1260, named chao, and exceeded the supply far beyond the metal backing, with predictably disastrous consequences. As the value of the money collapsed, the people fell into abject poverty, with many peasants resorting to selling their children into debt slavery.

Had European nations remained on the gold standard, or had the people of Europe held their own gold in their own hands, forcing government to resort to taxation instead of inflation, history might have been different. It is likely that World War I would have been settled militarily within a few months of conflict, as one of the allied factions started running out of financing and faced difficulties in extracting wealth from a population that was not willing to part with its wealth to defend their regime's survival.

Instead of market participants freely choosing the most salable good as a medium of exchange, the value, supply, and interest rate for money now became centrally planned by national governments, a monetary system which Hayek named Monetary Nationalism, in a brilliant short book of the same name: By Monetary Nationalism I mean the doctrine that a country's share in the world's supply of money should not be left to be determined by the same principles and the same mechanism as those which determine the relative amounts of money in its different regions or localities. A truly International Monetary System would be one where the whole world possessed a homogeneous currency such as obtains within separate countries and where its flow between regions was left to be determined by the results of the action of all individuals.5

Liaquat Ahamed's Lords of Finance focuses on this episode, and does a good job of discussing the individuals involved and the drama taking place, but adopts the reigning Keynesian understanding of the issue, putting the blame for the entire episode on the gold standard. In spite of his extensive research, Ahamed fails to comprehend that the problem was not the gold standard, but that post–World War I governments had wanted to return to the gold standard at the pre–World War I rates. Had they admitted to their people the magnitude of the devaluation that took place to fight the war, and re-pegged their currencies to gold at new rates, there would have probably been a recessionary crash, after which the economy would have recovered on a sound monetary basis.

In order to remove the golden fetters to inflationism, President Roosevelt issued an executive order banning the private ownership of gold, forcing Americans to sell their gold to the U.S. Treasury at a rate of $20.67 per ounce. With the population deprived of sound money, and forced to deal with dollars, Roosevelt then revalued the dollar on the international market from $20.67 per ounce to $35 per ounce, a 41% devaluation of the dollar in real terms (gold). This was the inevitable reality of years of inflationism which started in 1914 with the creation of the Federal Reserve and the financing of America's entry into World War II.

Having never studied economics or researched it professionally, Keynes captured the zeitgeist of omnipotent government to come up with the definitive track that gave governments what they wanted to hear. Gone were all the foundations of economic knowledge acquired over centuries of scholarship around the world, to be replaced with the new faith with the ever-so-convenient conclusions that suited high time-preference politicians and totalitarian governments: the state of the economy is determined by the lever of aggregate spending, and any rise in unemployment or slowdown in production had no underlying causes in the structure of production or in the distortion of markets by central planners; rather it was all a shortage of spending, and the remedy is the debauching of the currency and the increase of government spending. Saving reduces spending and because spending is all that matters, government must do all it can to deter its citizens from saving. Imports drive workers out of work, so spending increases must go on domestic goods. Governments loved this message, and Keynes himself knew that. His book was translated into German in 1937, at the height of the Nazi era, and in the introduction to the German edition Keynes wrote: The theory of aggregate production, which is the point of the following book, nevertheless can be much easier adapted to the conditions of a totalitarian state than the theory of production and distribution of a given production put forth under conditions of free competition and a large degree of laissez-faire.7 The Keynesian deluge, from which the world is yet to recover, had begun.

The classical liberal tradition that viewed economic freedom as the foundation of economic prosperity was quietly brushed aside as government propagandists masquerading as economists presented the Great Depression, caused and exacerbated by government controls, as the refutation of free markets. Classical liberals were the enemies of the political regimes of the 1930s; murdered and chased away from Russia, Italy, Germany, and Austria, they were fortunate to only be academically persecuted in the United States and the U.K., where these giants struggled to find employment while middling bureaucrats and failed statisticians filled every university economics department with their scientism and fake certainty.

As the major economies of the world went off the gold standard, global trade was soon to be shipwrecked on the shores of oscillating fiat money. With no standard of value to allow an international price mechanism to exist, and with governments increasingly captured by statist and isolationist impulses, currency manipulation emerged as a tool of trade policy, with countries seeking to devalue their currencies in order to give their exporters an advantage. More trade barriers were erected, and economic nationalism became the ethos of that era, with predictably disastrous consequences. The nations that had prospered together 40 years earlier, trading under one universal gold standard, now had large monetary and trade barriers between them, loud populist leaders who blamed all their failures on other nations, and a rising tide of hateful nationalism that was soon to fulfill Otto Mallery's prophecy: “If soldiers are not to cross international boundaries, goods must do so. Unless the Shackles can be dropped from trade, bombs will be dropped from the sky.”8

This gave rise to the second process, a divergence in practices. A difference of intellectual emphasis became a political division, and the gulf between the two positions came to define the new era of confrontation. The Bush formulation inserted an expansionary dynamic (the enlargement of the victorious Atlantic community) into the end of the Cold War; whereas Gorbachev and successive Russian leaders sought to exploit the opening to transcend the conflict in its entirety and to gain some historical space to devise native-grown solutions rather than accepting solutions devised elsewhere. The enlargement agenda came into conflict with the transformative view. Later, the expansive version, in the form of NATO and European Union (EU) enlargement, was radicalised by the newly free countries hedging (some would say over-balancing) against a possible recrudescence of Russian power. However, by denying the logic of transcendence, they precipitated the result that they sought to avert. Europe could not be ‘whole and free’ if Russia was effectively excluded. It was offered associate membership of an existing enterprise (what I shall call the Historical West), but Russia’s enduring aspiration was to become a founder member of a transformed Greater West.

The Western insistence on transcendent ‘values’ rendered them by definition a property of the enlarging Atlantic community. Instead of defining democratisation as a common challenge, it became seen as the ideological arm of an expansive power system. This provoked a range of adverse reactions in Moscow, and in the end Russia reacted by adopting a policy of resistance to what was considered a hegemonic power system that asserted its values not as an autonomous good but as part of the enlarging power system. The assertion of a values-based foreign policy came to be seen as a way of denigrating the interests and the political subjectivity of the entity on which the values are projected. As we shall see, it was not that Russia repudiated the values, but the political order in which they were framed. The expansion of a universal value system denigrated the traditional state-centric model of international relations and was perceived as a threat not only to Russia’s status as a great power, but to its security and very existence as an independent subject of international politics.

The unprecedented dominance of the Atlantic system provoked its radicalisation. In the early 2000s the ideology of American leadership and exceptionalism became more sharply delineated as American primacy and global hegemony was consolidated. This was accompanied by the extension of the rule-based system of international order proclaimed by liberal theory, but the tension with hegemonic American leadership was not resolved.

The fourth element is developments within Russia itself. Russia’s domestic politics are not the focus of this book, but some discussion here and later provides context for foreign policy developments.16 Liberals argue that foreign policy reflects the character of domestic politics, a claim rejected by most realists. In the Russian case, all leaders irrespective of the degree to which they may be democratic believe that the country is a great power by right.17 Social reality may well be constructed, but certain themes endure.

The late Soviet and then the Russian leadership had assumed that the world would become more plural (later advanced by Primakov and his successors through the formula of multipolarity), but instead a monist system was consolidated. Instead of the end of communism opening up debate about different types of political community and alternative ways of embedding market relations into the societal nexus, discourse became remarkably impoverished and monological. Globalisation and end of history narratives only reasserted the apparent victory of the ‘liberal international order’, instead of enriching the debate over varieties of capitalism and new ways of achieving the material and spiritual enrichment of communities globally through empowerment and equality.

The fundamental dynamic would no longer have been expansion but the transformation of the pan-European political community.5 Instead, the positions hardened and the gulf between Russia and the Historical West widened. The Western powers were exasperated that their benign intentions could be construed as expansive in the aggressive sense; and Russia was increasingly frustrated by the Atlantic system’s inexorable advance that seemed not only to negate Russia’s concerns about changes in the power balance in its neighbourhood, but to delegitimise the language in which these concerns could be expressed. In the cold peace years there remained the residual belief that some way would be found of reconciling these differences, although the frustrations expressed by Putin in Munich in 2007 found their counterpart in the no less anguished discourse of Western leaders at Russia’s apparent self-isolation and obtuse refusal to join one of the most successful alliances in history.

The constructivist argument that if you identify someone as an enemy, in due course they will become one, works both ways. The notion of ‘Russian aggression’ was reinforced by the Ukraine crisis but had deep roots in the structure of post-Cold War international relations. Russia’s frustration at what it perceived to be its strategic impasse provoked a constant rhetoric of resistance and challenge, which was inevitably seen by the Atlantic community as the rumblings of an angry and potentially dangerous adversary. The negative transcendence of the Cold War reinforced Russia’s sense of having been boxed into a corner after 1989, whereas it considered itself a partner in the new system of international politics. This in turn gave rise to the narrative of Western persecution, ‘Russophobia’ and humiliation, reinforcing traditional narratives about the fundamental incompatibility between Russia and the West.

International relations today are more perilous than at any time since 1989. The original Cold War was a regional confrontation with global implications, while the present confrontation is a global process with regional implications. New ways of managing conflict between what are emerging as two clearly delineated blocs are required, otherwise there is a real danger of an accidental slide into war.

The end of World War II and the dismantling of the New Deal meant the U.S. government cut its spending by an astonishing 75% between 1944 and 1948, and it also removed most price controls for good measure. And yet, the U.S. economy witnessed an extraordinary boom during these years. The roughly ten million men who were mobilized for the war came back home and were almost seamlessly absorbed into the labor force, as economic production boomed, flying in the face of all Keynesian predictions and utterly obliterating the ridiculous notion that the level of spending is what determines output in the economy. As soon as governmental central planning had abated for the first time since the 1929 crash, and as soon as prices were allowed to adjust freely, they served their role as the coordinating mechanism for economic activity, matching sellers and buyers, incentivizing the production of goods demanded by consumers and compensating workers for their effort. The situation was far from perfect, though, as the world remained off the gold standard, leading to ever-present distortions of the money supply which would continue to dog the world economy with crisis after crisis.

It is well-known that history is written by the victors, but in the era of government money, victors get to decide on the monetary systems, too. The United States summoned representatives of its allies to Bretton Woods in New Hampshire to discuss formulating a new global trading system. History has not been very kind to the architects of this system. Britain's representative was none other than John Maynard Keynes, whose economic teachings were to be wrecked on the shores of reality in the decades following the war, while America's representative, Harry Dexter White, would later be uncovered as a Communist who was in contact with the Soviet regime for many years.11 In the battle for centrally planned global monetary orders, White was to emerge victorious with a plan that even made Keynes's look not entirely unhinged. The United States was to be the center of the global monetary system, with its dollars being used as a global reserve currency by other central banks, whose currencies would be convertible to dollars at fixed exchange rates, while the dollar itself would be convertible to gold at a fixed exchange rate. To facilitate this system, the United States would take gold from other countries' central banks.

Sound money is chosen freely on the market for its salability, because it holds its value across time, because it can transfer value effectively across space, and because it can be divided and grouped into small and large scales.

the importance of sound money can be explained for three broad reasons: first, it protects value across time, which gives people a bigger incentive to think of their future, and lowers their time preference. The lowering of the time preference is what initiates the process of human civilization and allows for humans to cooperate, prosper, and live in peace. Second, sound money allows for trade to be based on a stable unit of measurement, facilitating ever-larger markets, free from government control and coercion, and with free trade comes peace and prosperity. Further, a unit of account is essential for all forms of economic calculation and planning, and unsound money makes economic calculation unreliable and is the root cause of economic recessions and crises. Finally, sound money is an essential requirement for individual freedom from despotism and repression, as the ability of a coercive state to create money can give it undue power over its subjects, power which by its very nature will attract the least worthy, and most immoral, to take its reins.

This is the essence of investment: as humans delay immediate gratification, they invest their time and resources in the production of capital goods which will make production more sophisticated or technologically advanced and extend it over a longer time-horizon. The only reason that an individual would choose to delay his gratification to engage in risky production over a longer period of time is that these longer processes will generate more output and superior goods. In other words, investment raises the productivity of the producer.

There are many factors that come into play in determining the time preference of individuals.3 Security of people in their person and property is arguably one of the most important. Individuals who live in areas of conflict and crime will have a significant chance of losing their life and are thus likely to more highly discount the future, resulting in a higher time preference than those who live in peaceful societies. Security of property is another major factor influencing individuals' time preference: societies where governments or thieves are likely to expropriate individuals' property capriciously would have higher time preference, as such actions would drive individuals to prioritize spending their resources on immediate gratification rather than investing them in property which could be appropriated at any time. Tax rates will also adversely affect time preference:

Cool thing about pendulums: The time it takes for one to swing forward and backward—the period—won’t change, no matter how wide it swings. If it’s got a lot of energy, it’ll swing farther and faster, but the period will still be the same. This is what mechanical clocks take advantage of to keep time. That period ends up being driven by two things, and two things only: the length of the pendulum and gravity.

Light is a funny thing. Its wavelength defines what it can and can’t interact with. Anything smaller than the wavelength is functionally nonexistent to that photon. That’s why there’s a mesh over the window of a microwave. The holes in the mesh are too small for microwaves to pass through. But visible light, with a much shorter wavelength, can go through freely. So you get to watch your food cook without melting your face off. Astrophage is smaller than 18.31 microns but somehow still absorbs light at that frequency.

When economic decision making is geared toward the future, it is natural that all manner of decisions are geared toward the future as well. People become more peaceful and cooperative, understanding that cooperation is a far more rewarding long-term strategy than any short-term gains from conflict. People develop a strong sense of morality, prioritizing the moral choices that will cause the best long-term outcomes for them and their children. A person who thinks of the long run is less likely to cheat, lie, or steal, because the reward for such activities may be positive in the short run, but can be devastatingly negative in the long run.

The move from money that holds its value or appreciates to money that loses its value is very significant in the long run: society saves less, accumulates less capital, and possibly begins to consume its capital; worker productivity stays constant or declines, resulting in the stagnation of real wages, even if nominal wages can be made to increase through the magical power of printing ever more depreciating pieces of paper money. As people start spending more and saving less, they become more present-oriented in all their decision making, resulting in moral failings and a likelihood to engage in conflict and destructive and self-destructive behavior.

Further, as increases in the money supply effectively mean low interest rates, the incentive to save and invest is diminished while the incentive to borrow increases. The track record of the 46-year experiment with unsound money bears out this conclusion. Savings rates have been declining across the developed countries, dropping to very low levels, while personal, municipal, and national debts have increased to levels which would have seemed unimaginable in the past. (See Figure 12.11) Only Switzerland, which remained on an official gold standard until 1936, and continued to back its currency with large reserves of gold until the early 1990s, has continued to have a high savings rate, standing as the last bastion of low-time-preference Western civilization with a savings rate in the double digits, as every other Western economy has plummeted into the single digits and even to negative saving rates in some cases.

It is an ironic sign of the depth of modern-day economic ignorance fomented by Keynesian economics that capitalism—an economic system based on capital accumulation from saving—is blamed for unleashing conspicuous consumption—the exact opposite of capital accumulation. Capitalism is what happens when people drop their time preference, defer immediate gratification, and invest in the future. Debt-fueled mass consumption is as much a normal part of capitalism as asphyxiation is a normal part of respiration.

In a traditional society, individuals are aware that they will need children to support them in the future, and so will spend their healthy young years starting a family and investing in giving their children the best life possible. But if long-term investment in general is disincentivized, if saving is likely to be counterproductive as money depreciates, this investment becomes less profitable. Further, as politicians sell people the lie that eternal welfare and retirement benefits are possible through the magic of the monetary printing press, the investment in a family becomes less and less valuable. Over time, the incentive to start a family declines and more and more people end up leading single lives. More marriages are likely to break down as partners are less likely to put in the necessary emotional, moral, and financial investment to make them work, while marriages that do survive will likely produce fewer children. The well-known phenomenon of the modern breakdown of the family cannot be understood without recognizing the role of unsound money allowing the state to appropriate many of the essential roles that the family has played for millennia, and reducing the incentive of all members of a family to invest in long-term familial relations.

A stroll through a modern art gallery shows artistic works whose production requires no more effort or talent than can be mustered by a bored 6-year-old. Modern artists have replaced craft and long hours of practice with pretentiousness, shock value, indignation, and existential angst as ways to cow audiences into appreciating their art, and often added some pretense to political ideals, usually of the puerile Marxist variety, to pretend-play profundity. To the extent that anything good can be said about modern “art,” it is that it is clever, in the manner of a prank or practical joke. There is nothing beautiful or admirable about the output or the process of most modern art, because it was produced in a matter of hours by lazy talentless hacks who never bothered to practice their craft. Only cheap pretentiousness, obscenity, and shock value attract attention to the naked emperor of modern art, and only long pretentious diatribes shaming others for not understanding the work give it value.

The fatal flaw of socialism that Mises exposed was that without a price mechanism emerging on a free market, socialism would fail at economic calculation, most crucially in the allocation of capital goods.4 As discussed earlier, capital production involves progressively sophisticated methods of production, longer time horizons, and a larger number of intermediate goods not consumed for their own sake, but only produced so as to take part in the production of final consumer goods in the future. Sophisticated structures of production only emerge from an intricate web of individual calculations by producers of each capital and consumer good buying and selling inputs and outputs to one another.5 The most productive allocation is determined only through the price mechanism allowing the most productive users of capital goods to bid highest for them. The supply and demand of capital goods emerges from the interaction of the producers and consumers and their iterative decisions. In a socialist system, government owns and controls the means of production, making it at once the sole buyer and seller of all capital goods in the economy. That centralization stifles the functioning of an actual market, making sound decisions based on prices impossible.

Friedman and Schwartz barely discuss the causes of the 1893 recession, alluding to a drive for silver due to gold not being sufficient to cover the monetary needs of the economy, and then inundating the reader with trivia about the recession in that year. They fail to mention the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 approved by the U.S. Congress, which required the U.S. Treasury to buy large quantities of silver with a new issue of Treasury notes. Seeing as silver had been almost entirely demonetized worldwide at that point, people who held silver or Treasury notes sought to convert them to gold, leading to a drain on the Treasury's gold reserves. Effectively, the Treasury had engaged in a large misguided dose of monetary expansionism by increasing the money supply to try to pretend that silver was still money. All that did was devalue U.S. Treasury notes, creating a financial bubble which crashed as withdrawals of gold accelerated. Any history book of the period could make this clear to anyone with a cursory understanding of monetary theory, but Friedman and Schwartz impressively avoid any mention of this.

The net effect of a rise in the money supply and fast economic growth was that the price level did not rise a lot, but that asset prices rose heavily—mainly housing and stocks; the increased money supply had not translated to a rise in consumer good prices because it had mainly been directed by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the stock and housing markets.

The former didn't last long even though the Fed did not intervene in the way the authors recommend. Second, why is it that the United States had never suffered a financial crisis in the nineteenth century during the period when there was no central bank, except in the two instances when Congress had directed the Treasury to act like a central bank: during the Civil War with the printing of the greenbacks, and in 1890 after the monetization of silver? Third, and most tellingly, how did the United States manage one of its longest periods of sustained economic growth without any financial crises between 1873 and 1890 when there was no central bank at all, and the money supply was restricted, and the price level continued to drop? Friedman and Schwartz only mention this era in passing, remarking that the economy grew impressively “in spite” of the price level dropping, without caring to comment on how such a fact flies in the face of their price-level-drop phobia.

If Keynes's model had any truth to it, it would then necessarily follow that there can be no example of a society experiencing high inflation and high unemployment at the same time. But this has in fact happened many times, most notably in the United States in the 1970s, when, in spite of the assurances of Keynesian economists to the contrary, and in spite of the entire U.S. establishment, from President Nixon down to “free market economist” Milton Friedman, adopting the refrain, “We're all Keynesians now” as the government took it upon itself to eliminate unemployment with increased inflation, unemployment kept on rising as inflation soared, destroying the theory that there is a trade-off between these two.

The sum total of the contribution of both these schools of thought is the consensus taught in undergraduate macroeconomics courses across the world: that the central bank should be in the business of expanding the money supply at a controlled pace, to encourage people to spend more and thus keep the unemployment level sufficiently low. Should a central bank contract the money supply, or fail to expand it adequately, then a deflationary spiral can take place, which would discourage people from spending their money and thus harm employment and cause an economic downturn.6

If society were a little girl in that marshmallow experiment, Keynesian economics seeks to alter the experiment so that waiting would punish the girl by giving her half a marshmallow instead of two, making the entire concept of self-control and low time preference appear counterproductive.

There are three fundamental reasons that drive the relationship between unsound money and war. First, unsound money is itself a barrier to trade between countries, because it distorts value between the countries and makes trade flows a political issue, creating animosity and enmity between governments and populations. Second, government having access to a printing press allows it to continue fighting until it completely destroys the value of its currency, and not just until it runs out of money. With sound money, the government's war effort was limited by the taxes it could collect. With unsound money, it is restrained by how much money it can create before the currency is destroyed, making it able to appropriate wealth far more easily. Third, individuals dealing with sound money develop a lower time preference, allowing them to think more of cooperation rather than conflict, as discussed in Chapter 5.

It was after this war that the West suffered from what Barzun terms “The Great Switch,” the replacement of liberalism by liberality, the impostor claiming its mantle but in reality being its exact opposite.14 Liberalism triumphed on the principle that the best government is that which governs least; now for all the western nations political wisdom has recast this ideal of liberty into liberality. The shift has thrown the vocabulary into disorder. Whereas liberalism held the role of government as allowing individuals to live in liberty and enjoy the benefits, and suffer the consequences, of their actions, liberality was the radical notion that it was government's role to allow individuals to indulge in all their desires while protecting them from the consequences. Socially, economically, and politically, the role of government was recast as the wish-granting genie, and the population merely had to vote for what it wanted to have fulfilled.

Unsound money, on the other hand, allows governments to buy allegiance and popularity by spending on achieving popular objectives without having to present the bill to their people. Government simply increases the money supply to finance any harebrained scheme it concocts, and the true cost of such schemes is only felt by the population in years to come when the inflation of the money supply causes prices to rise, at which point the destruction of the value of the currency can be easily blamed on myriad factors, usually involving some nefarious plots by foreigners, bankers, local ethnic minorities, or previous or future governments. Unsound money is a particularly dangerous tool in the hands of modern democratic governments facing constant reelection pressure. Modern voters are unlikely to favor the candidates who are upfront about the costs and benefits of their schemes; they are far more likely to go with the scoundrels who promise a free lunch and blame the bill on their predecessors or some nefarious conspiracy. Democracy thus becomes a mass delusion of people attempting to override the rules of economics by voting themselves a free lunch and being manipulated into violent tantrums against scapegoats whenever the bill for the free lunch arrives via inflation and economic recessions.

Unsound money was a boon to tyrants, repressive regimes, and illegitimate governments by allowing them to avoid the reality of costs and benefits by increasing the money supply to finance their undertakings first, and letting the population handle the consequences later as they witness their wealth and purchasing power evaporate. History is replete with examples of how governments that have the prerogative to create money out of thin air have almost always abused this privilege by turning it against their own people.

In other words, the Keynesian conception of the state, from which came the modern central banking doctrines held widely by all central bankers, and which shape the vast majority of economic textbooks written worldwide, comes from a place of a man who wanted government direction of two important areas of life: first, the control of money, credit, saving, and investment decisions, which meant the totalitarian centralization of capital allocation and destruction of free individual enterprise, making individuals utterly dependent on government for their basic survival, and second, the control of population quantity and quality, which meant eugenics. And unlike socialists, Keynes did not seek this level of control over individuals in order to enhance their freedom in the long run, but rather to develop a grander vision of society as he sees fit. While socialists may have had the decency to at least pretend to want to enslave man for his own good, to free him in the future, Keynes wanted government enslavement for its own sake, as the ultimate end. This may help explain why Murray Rothbard said, “There is only one good thing about Marx, at least he was not a Keynesian.”18

Any firm that produces outputs valued at less than its inputs would go out of business, its resources freed up to be used by other, more productive firms, in what economist Joseph Schumpeter termed creative destruction. There can be no profit in a free market without the real risk of loss, and everyone is forced to have skin in the game: failure is always a real possibility, and can be costly. Government-issued unsound money, however, can stall this process, keeping unproductive firms undead but not truly alive, the economic equivalent of zombies or vampires drawing on the resources of the alive and productive firms to produce things of less value than the resources needed to make them.

Since the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, the separation between deposit and investment banking has been removed, and so the deposit banks who had FDIC deposit guarantee can now also engage in investment financing, having the FDIC guarantee protect them from investment losses. An investor who has a loss guarantee has a free option, effectively, a license to print money. Making profitable investments allows them to accrue all the gains, whereas losses can be socialized. Anybody with such a guarantee can make large amounts of money by simply borrowing and investing his money. He gets to keep the profits, but will have his losses covered. It is no wonder that this has led to an ever-larger share of the capital and labor resources gravitating toward finance, as it's the closest thing the world has to a free lunch.

Satoshi Nakamoto's motivation for bitcoin was to create a “purely peer-to-peer form of electronic cash” that would not require trust in third parties for transactions and whose supply cannot be altered by any other party. In other words, bitcoin would bring the desirable features of physical cash (lack of intermediaries, finality of transactions) to the digital realm and combine them with an ironclad monetary policy that cannot be manipulated to produce unexpected inflation to benefit an outside party at the expense of holders. Nakamoto succeeded in achieving this through the utilization of a few important though not widely understood technologies: a distributed peer-to-peer network with no single point of failure, hashing, digital signatures, and proof-of-work.2

Hal Finney, the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto, wrote this on the bitcoin forum in 2010: Actually there is a very good reason for bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases. Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others. George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating. I believe this will be the ultimate fate of bitcoin, to be the “high-powered money” that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as … well, as bitcoin based purchases are today.

If bitcoin continues to appreciate significantly, it will provide the central bank more flexibility with their monetary policy and international account settlement. But perhaps the real case for central banks owning bitcoin is as insurance against the scenario of it succeeding. Given that the supply of bitcoins is strictly limited, it may be wise for a central bank to spend a small amount acquiring a small portion of bitcoin's supply today in case it appreciates significantly in the future. If bitcoin continues to appreciate while a central bank doesn't own any of it, then the market value of their reserve currencies and gold will be declining in terms of bitcoin, placing the central bank at a disadvantage the later it decides to acquire reserves.

In the nineteenth century, the term cash referred to central bank gold reserves, and cash settlement was the transfer of physical gold between banks. If this analysis is correct, and bitcoin continues to grow in value and off-chain transactions while on-chain transactions do not grow as much, bitcoin would be better understood as cash in the old meaning of the term, similar to gold cash reserves, rather than the modern term for cash as paper money for small transactions.

The basic elements of this story are repeated in the lives of all of the great Masters in history: a youthful passion or predilection, a chance encounter that allows them to discover how to apply it, an apprenticeship in which they come alive with energy and focus. They excel by their ability to practice harder and move faster through the process, all of this stemming from the intensity of their desire to learn and from the deep connection they feel to their field of study. And at the core of this intensity of effort is in fact a quality that is genetic and inborn—not talent or brilliance, which is something that must be developed, but rather a deep and powerful inclination toward a particular subject.

In the past, only elites or those with an almost superhuman amount of energy and drive could pursue a career of their choice and master it. A man was born into the military, or groomed for the government, chosen among those of the right class. If he happened to display a talent and desire for such work it was mostly a coincidence. Millions of people who were not part of the right social class, gender, and ethnic group were rigidly excluded from the possibility of pursuing their calling. Even if people wanted to follow their inclinations, access to the information and knowledge pertaining to that particular field was controlled by elites. That is why there are relatively few Masters in the past and why they stand out so much. These social and political barriers, however, have mostly disappeared. Today we have the kind of access to information and knowledge that past Masters could only dream about. Now more than ever, we have the capacity and freedom to move toward the inclination that all of us possess as part of our genetic uniqueness. It is time that the word “genius” becomes demystified and de-rarefied.

Do not talk about giftedness, inborn talents! One can name great men of all kinds who were very little gifted. They acquired greatness, became “geniuses” (as we put it), through qualities the lack of which no one who knew what they were would boast of: they all possessed that seriousness of the efficient workman which first learns to construct the parts properly before it ventures to fashion a great whole; they allowed themselves time for it, because they took more pleasure in making the little, secondary things well than in the effect of a dazzling whole. —FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE

Second, with this connection established, you must look at the career path you are already on or are about to begin. The choice of this path—or redirection of it—is critical. To help in this stage you will need to enlarge your concept of work itself. Too often we make a separation in our lives—there is work and there is life outside work, where we find real pleasure and fulfillment.

Instead you want to see your work as something more inspiring, as part of your vocation. The word “vocation” comes from the Latin meaning to call or to be called. Its use in relation to work began in early Christianity—certain people were called to a life in the church; that was their vocation. They could recognize this literally by hearing a voice from God, who had chosen them for this profession. Over time, the word became secularized, referring to any work or study that a person felt was suited to his or her interests, particularly a manual craft. It is time, however, that we return to the original meaning of the word, for it comes much closer to the idea of a Life’s Task and mastery.

Finally, you must see your career or vocational path more as a journey with twists and turns rather than a straight line. You begin by choosing a field or position that roughly corresponds to your inclinations. This initial position offers you room to maneuver and important skills to learn. You don’t want to start with something too lofty, too ambitious—you need to make a living and establish some confidence. Once on this path you discover certain side routes that attract you, while other aspects of this field leave you cold. You adjust and perhaps move to a related field, continuing to learn more about yourself, but always expanding off your skill base. Like Leonardo, you take what you do for others and make it your own.

Eventually, you will hit upon a particular field, niche, or opportunity that suits you perfectly. You will recognize it when you find it because it will spark that childlike sense of wonder and excitement; it will feel right. Once found, everything will fall into place. You will learn more quickly and more deeply. Your skill level will reach a point where you will be able to claim your independence from within the group you work for and move out on your own. In a world in which there is so much we cannot control, this will bring you the ultimate form of power. You will determine your circumstances. As your own Master, you will no longer be subject to the whims of tyrannical bosses or scheming peers.

These childhood attractions are hard to put into words and are more like sensations—that of deep wonder, sensual pleasure, power, and heightened awareness. The importance of recognizing these preverbal inclinations is that they are clear indications of an attraction that is not infected by the desires of other people. They are not something embedded in you by your parents, which come with a more superficial connection, something more verbal and conscious. Coming instead from somewhere deeper, they can only be your own, reflections of your unique chemistry.

recognizing the model of masculinity that permeated École navale, I began to analyze its inextricable link to a dominant model of American masculinity. This form of American “hegemonic masculinity” sustained a patriarchal political and social order, not only within the United States, but also throughout the world, influencing and shaping the international landscape. As Mike Donaldson explains in “What is Hegemonic Masculinity?” military institutions, and the men they develop, became the agents of hegemonic masculinity, and their tools -- “violence, aggression, risk-taking, physical discipline” – became the tools of hegemonic masculinity.

Although dominant models of masculinity shape both French and American militaries, I contend that in certain international contexts, the French model of masculinity is subordinate to the American hegemonic model, just as the French military is smaller in scale and scope than the American one. This stratified system of masculinity explained why I observed French midshipmen learning to brief in English, lobbying intensely for the few coveted exchange slots at United States Naval Academy (USNA) and idealizing American military hardware. It also explained why, as time passed, these young naval officers, eventually promoted into more senior roles, continued to strive to match the strength of the most powerful hegemonic state on Earth.

Such “cultural close readings” should consider gender in all its details, from the sexy posters on the wall to the casual slang employed.  FAOs should continuously ask the question, especially when immersed in male-dominated environments, “And what are the women doing?” Such a question was only asked until relatively recently, for example, in the conflict against Boko Haram, a group that has weaponized women to great effect.  Only by developing a heightened awareness of gender, and in particular the models of masculinity that dominate in militaries and security affairs, where women are often lost in the shadows, will FAOs develop a fuller picture of a culture and its security concerns.

In 1972, sociologists Richard Nisbett and Edward Jones hypothesized that perceptual asymmetry lay at the heart of most conflicts. They further suggested that bridging this asymmetry would assist in most conflict resolutions. They were right. Their key observation was this: People view their own behaviors as originating from situations beyond their control, but they view other people’s behaviors as originating from inherent personality traits. Say a guy arrives late for a date. He is likely to ascribe his tardiness to external factors (being caught in traffic). She is likely to ascribe his tardiness to being a careless person (not taking traffic into account). One invokes a situational constraint to explain being late. The other invokes an insult.

Couples who regularly practice empathy see stunning results. It is the independent variable that predicts a successful marriage, according to behaviorist John Gottman, who, post hoc criticisms notwithstanding, forecasts divorce probabilities with accuracy rates approaching 90 percent. In Gottman’s studies, if the wife felt she was being heard by her husband—to the point that he accepted her good influence on his behavior—the marriage was essentially divorce-proof. (Interestingly, whether the husband felt heard was not a factor in divorce rates.) If that empathy trafficking was absent, the marriage foundered.

Within the United States, Friedman had a remarkable influence on policy along a number of lines. He led the intellectual opposition against the military draft, promoting economic arguments against the draft based on the idea of opportunity cost, and he chaired a commission that both recommended against the draft and led to its abolition. Since that time, the military draft has not returned to the United States, and it is not even a serious object of discussion, indicating that Friedman made the right call on that one. [7

Overall, when it comes to real-world policy influence, Friedman does very very well in that category. Friedman receives a lot of criticism for being “too free market,” or for being “too neoliberal,” whatever that is supposed to mean. This isn’t the time or the place to debate all of those normative questions, but most of the actual practical changes that have come from the work of Milton Friedman have become broadly accepted rather than ideologically controversial. For better or worse, we do not live in the world outlined in Friedman’s popular economics tract and television show Free to Choose , or his earlier 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom , which called for a move toward much smaller government.

Money demand simply was not stable, in part due to interest paid on bank reserves held at the Fed. Later in his life Friedman moved away from the notion of strict money supply targeting, and evinced some interest in price inflation rules and also some interest in free banking ideas. Whether or not that was the correct intellectual evolution, it raises the question of what exactly was left standing of Friedman’s earlier strong insistence on the relevance of money supply metrics.

The first was his analysis of inflation and unemployment, as laid out most famously in his 1968 presidential address to the American Economic Association. Once again, Friedman took the Keynesians to be his whipping boy and he beat them. Keynesian theory of the time predicted you would either have inflation (excess aggregate demand) or unemployment (insufficient aggregate demand). But Friedman showed that boosting inflation was no clear path to higher employment, as over time workers would adjust their expectations and they would not be tricked by the monetary expansion. Friedman in essence predicted that stagflation – both inflation and high unemployment together – would be possible, and lo and behold that is exactly what the later 1970s delivered.

The year before, he had damned the games as the invention of “Jews and Freemasons.” The very heart of the Olympic ideal—that athletes of all nations and all races should commingle and compete on equal terms—was antithetical to his National Socialist Party’s core belief: that the Aryan people were manifestly superior to all others. And he was filled with revulsion by the notion that Jews, Negroes, and other vagabond races from around the world would come traipsing through Germany.

They seemed, as a rule, self-made, rough hewn, wild, native, brawny, simple, and perhaps, in the eyes of some, a bit coarse; their eastern counterparts seemed, as a rule, well bred, sophisticated, moneyed, refined, and perhaps, in their own eyes at least, a bit superior.

Perhaps the seeds of redemption lay not just in perseverance, hard work, and rugged individualism. Perhaps they lay in something more fundamental—the simple notion of everyone pitching in and pulling together.

There was a straightforward reason for what was happening. The boys in the Clipper had been winnowed down by punishing competition, and in the winnowing a kind of common character had issued forth: they were all skilled, they were all tough, they were all fiercely determined, but they were also all good-hearted. Every one of them had come from humble origins or been humbled by the ravages of the hard times in which they had grown up. Each in his own way, they had all learned that nothing could be taken for granted in life, that for all their strength and good looks and youth, forces were at work in the world that were greater than they. The challenges they had faced together had taught them humility—the need to subsume their individual egos for the sake of the boat as a whole—and humility was the common gateway through which they were able now to come together and begin to do what they had not been able to do before

On the morning of March 7, thirty thousand German troops had rolled into the demilitarized Rhineland, in open defiance of both the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Pact to which Germany was a signatory. It was by far the most brazen thing Hitler had yet attempted, his biggest gamble, and a major step toward the catastrophe that was soon to envelop the world. For the next two days, Hitler, Goebbels, and the rest of the Nazi leadership waited anxiously for the world to react. They knew that Germany did not yet have sufficient military strength to survive a war with either France or Britain, let alone the two of them combined. The next forty-eight hours, Hitler later confessed, were the tensest of his life. He needn’t have worried. In England, foreign secretary Anthony Eden said he “deeply regretted” the news, and then set about pressuring the French not to overreact. They didn’t. They did nothing at all. A relieved Joseph Goebbels sat down and wrote, “The Fuehrer is immensely happy . . . England remains passive. France won’t act alone. Italy is disappointed and America is uninterested.”

He’d been added to the boat last, he’d often struggled to master the technical side of the sport, and he still tended to row erratically. But what Joe didn’t yet know—what he wouldn’t, in fact, fully realize until much later, when he and the other boys were becoming old men—was that every boy in the boat felt exactly the same that summer. Every one of them believed he was simply lucky to be rowing in the boat, that he didn’t really measure up to the obvious greatness of the other boys, and that he might fail the others at any moment. Every one of them was fiercely determined not to let that happen.

In doing that, Goebbels had not only created a compelling vision of the new Germany but also undercut the Nazis’ opponents in the West—whether they were American Jews in New York City or members of Parliament in London or anxious Parisians—making all of them seem shrill, hysterical, and misinformed. As thousands of Americans returned home from the games that fall, many of them felt as one quoted in a German propaganda publication did: “As for this man Hitler. . . .

My initiation into geekdom happened long before I quizzed my mom about punchcards and computers. It came when my parents enrolled me in a Montessori school at the age of three. For those unfamiliar with Montessori, here’s a quick explanation. Montessori classrooms are designed to be self-directed learning labs for children. I remember my first one as a large, light-filled room, parts of which were dedicated to different activities. In one area there were beads strung together on wires to form lines, squares, and cubes (which turns out to be a great way to convey the difference between x, x2, and x3). Another space had cloth letters I could play with to ease me into the concept of reading. Other areas had polygons to trace, 3D shapes to play with, simple abacuses, pens and pencils and paper, and so on. The gear in the classrooms was great, but what I really loved about my Montessori school was the freedom. There were a few scheduled activities each day—lunch, recess, “circle time,” when teachers and students sat on the floor in a circle and talked about stuff—but most of the time I could do what I wanted. And what I and my classmates wanted wasn’t to break things, run around yelling, or terrorize each other. Instead, we wanted to sit quietly and learn.

One of Montessori’s most radical insights was that even young children are capable of concentration and deep study in the right environment. They’re not inherently wild creatures that have to be penned. Instead, they’re inherent learners. They have reserves of self-discipline that are activated when they’re curious about something. Montessori wrote that “a child who has become master of his acts,… and who has been encouraged by the pleasant and interesting activities in which he has been engaged, is a child filled with health and joy and remarkable for his calmness and discipline.”

The pioneers of universal childhood education in the US and elsewhere were heavily influenced by the Prussian primary school system of the mid-nineteenth century.3 And the Prussian educators were in turn influenced by the philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte, who was clear that schooling really should be about breaking children’s spirits. He wrote in 1807: Education should aim at destroying free will so that after pupils are thus schooled they will be incapable throughout the rest of their lives of thinking or acting otherwise than as their schoolmasters would have wished.

One of my favorite “unknown” Milton Friedman pieces is his sharp criticism of the idea of a “commodity reserve currency,” published in 1951. This piece no longer attracts much attention, just as the notion of a commodity reserve currency has been defunct for decades. So I won’t work through the arguments, but nonetheless this is one of the best pieces to study Friedman's analytic mental engine. The rapier sword is pulled out and he simply never stops, with a remarkable density of analysis and then critique in virtually every paragraph. In the history of economics up until that time, there simply are not many if any comparable examples of such an exercise. Among its other virtues, this piece can be read without our political biases about Friedman – whatever they may be – getting in the way.

The work is titled Income from Professional Practice , and on the surface it is a mundane look at “the income structure of five professions,” namely medicine, dentistry, law, certified public accountancy, and consulting engineering. In reality, it is a serious and very high-quality look at the economics of human capital, the return to training and education, the allocation of talent across professions, and barriers to entry resulting from occupational licensing. It anticipates Gary Becker’s later work on human capital, essential to Chicago economics and also winning Becker a Nobel Prize. But Friedman got there first, with Kuznets of course, who himself later won a Nobel Prize for his work on national income accounting and economic statistics. Friedman’s first book was a major contribution, yet it was so overshadowed by his later work that hardly anyone knows about it – an enviable achievement.

Obviously, there is much here to make for incompetence in warfare. But this incompetence is augmented by another factor, namely the characteristics of some of those attracted to the military. Let us examine this hypothesis. By modern standards, and viewed from the outside, the nature of militarism may not seem very attractive, including as it does a number of attributes which are positively repellent to those who value personal freedom, egalitarianism and creative as opposed to destructive ends. This distaste is common to both C. P. Snow’s cultures. It is as strongly voiced in Einstein’s comment—‘This subject brings me to that vilest offspring of the herd mind—the odious militia. The man who enjoys marching in line and file to the strains of music falls below my contempt; he received his great brain by mistake—the spinal cord would have been amply sufficient’2—as it is in Thackeray’s—‘A man one degree removed from idiocy with brains sufficient to direct his powers of mischief and endurance may make a distinguished soldier.’

In other words, an individual with particular problems of a psychological kind may be expected to gravitate towards a group which he recognizes not only as containing fellow sufferers, but also as having developed effective ways of dealing with the special needs of its members. The therapeutic gain from such behaviour during the Second World War has been noted by Robert Holt. He wrote: It was a common clinical observation during the war that military service was an unusually good environment for men who lacked inner controls . . . The combination of absolute security, a strong institutional parent-substitute on whom one could lean unobtrusively, and socially approved outlets for aggression provided a form of social control that allowed impulses to be expressed in acceptable ways.3

Over time, though, Marshall grew frustrated at how long it took NASA to complete projects, especially lower-risk ones where there were no lives at stake. He also saw how much up-front planning took place before anything got tested or built. He came to believe that it would be possible to get better results by moving faster and learning by doing, even in the inherently complicated domains of systems engineering and space exploration. By taking a different approach, one centered around fast cycles of iteration and experimentation and a different risk model (of redundancy and low cost rather than removing all failure modes), he thought that it would be possible to land a craft on the moon for less than $100 million. Few of his colleagues or superiors agreed. Marshall recalled, “We were told in no uncertain terms that you cannot do it for under $1 billion, so go away.”

the geek way is not about a suite of technologies (like machine learning or robotics) or a style of strategic thinking. Instead, it’s about norms: behaviors that a group’s members expect of each other. Norms are extraordinarily important for any organization because they’re a kind of community policing: if you don’t follow them, your peers will let you know it and work to bring you back in line. Norms aren’t maintained solely by the bosses, and they aren’t all written down in the employee handbook. But even though they can seem nebulous, they’re powerful; they shape people’s behavior in deep ways.

The term was defined early in Chapter 4 to mean changes in culture that were major and seen as such at the time, that happened relatively suddenly, that were consciously intended, and that produced transformations which were lasting. As judged by these criteria, the manifold changes in building, visualizing, and verbalizing that were introduced in Russia under Peter in connection with his many reforms were such as to constitute a cultural revolution. The essence of that revolution was a rapid and sweeping Europeanization of Russian ways of making and doing things, and of thinking and talking about them. And Europeanization, in that day and age, was equivalent to modernization

Victory in the Northern War established the newly named Russian Empire as the leading power in northeastern Europe, which occasioned in turn a diplomatic revolution in the European state system. Thereafter no major question that divided the European powers except the partition of Africa was settled without Russian participation, which as often as not was decisive.

But the prolonged, eventually successful prosecution of the Northern War was certainly not the only factor impelling the Petrine revolution in Russia, even in its military and political aspects. Peter’s own character, tastes, and interests along with those of leading members of his company (like Menshikov or Prokopovich) were also a major factor. So, to a lesser extent, were the material and career concerns of numerous other members of the Petrine elite—the “several thousand subjects of the Russian nation, male and female,” in the words of one of them (Peter Shafirov), who had become “skilled in various European languages …and of such conduct moreover that they can be compared without shame to all other European peoples” (Chap. 6). These several thousand individuals, many of them (like Shafirov) foreign in origin, had gone to school on Peter’s orders, had served in his army and navy, had entered his bureaucracy or his diplomatic service, had adopted the new dress and manners at his behest, and had built and furnished their homes in the new style. In short, they had invested their futures and those of their children in the new Russia. We must not underestimate the complex of personal motives and passions driving and sustaining the Petrine revolution, a point frequently made, if only in passing, throughout this book and particularly in Chapter 1.

Peter became “the Great” in Russia—Pëtr velikii—because of the successful revolution he led. In doing so he did not, of course, act alone. No ruler ever does, not even the “Sovereign Tsar and Autocrat of Moscow and All Russia.” By longstanding tradition the tsar (or king) ruled in conjunction with a group of senior nobles (the boiarskaia duma, or boyars’ council), their decisions implemented by a welter of subordinate offices located in Moscow and the chief provincial towns.

Such learning was typical of educated clergy in contemporary Europe but was possessed by virtually none of the Russian clergy of the day, many of whom, steeped in Muscovite tradition, were naturally hostile to Peter’s rejection of much of that tradition. This gave Prokopovich and his colleagues their opening. Outspoken contempt for what they considered the ignorance and superstition of their Russian counterparts was followed by eager support of Peter’s educational initiatives and attempt to reform the Russian church along Anglican or Lutheran lines.

The abundance of surviving Petrine material is also the product of Peter’s own quite extraordinary energy and of his many reforms, for he issued many more laws, charters, and instructions than any Russian ruler before him. The surviving Petrine material even includes the more or less fragmentary records of a dozen nocturnal dreams he experienced between November 1714 and November 1716, evidence that is unique of its kind. In fact, the very existence of these records testifies to what might be called the modernity of Peter’s mind.

Our focus here is on Peter the great Europeanizer, on the ruler who decisively brought Russia, largely for the good, into Europe and the modern world. But other serious students of Russian history, it must be admitted, have found in the evidence a much more mixed, even sinister figure—at the worst, a tyrant comparable to Ivan the Terrible and the forerunner of Stalin. The problem is compounded by the common practice of confusing the person and the ruler, of attempting to apply ordinary human standards of decency or success to the actions of a leader burdened with challenges and responsibilities of a well-nigh superhuman kind. In short, it is likely that no final judgment on Peter, in the sense of a universally accepted assessment of his character and achievements, will ever be reached.19

cultural revolution thus underlay and ultimately linked up all of Peter’s revolutionary projects, “culture” being our common word for the innumerable ways human beings have of making and doing things, and of thinking and talking about them. Language is culture, as are literature, music, painting, sculpture, architecture, and the graphic arts; so are ways of cooking, fighting, dressing, governing, dancing, feasting, praying, courting, and so on. But the meaning of “cultural revolution,” a term used rather sparingly by historians, is perhaps less obvious.

The Protestant Reformation, one historian has argued, was not only “a legislative and administrative transaction tidily concluded by a religious settlement in 1559” but a “profound cultural revolution” as well. Another historian has shown how a cultural revolution occurred in conjunction with the political and social changes of the French Revolution of the late eighteenth century. Stalin is said to have launched a cultural revolution in Soviet Russia in 1928–1931 in order to consolidate his dictatorship. And the drastic changes in thinking about the natural world associated with the names of Copernicus, Descartes, Galileo, Newton, and Leibniz, among others, are still called, more than fifty years after the term was coined, the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century.1 It is notable that in each of these very different cases the changes in culture being discussed were major, and recognized as such by contemporaries. They were also consciously intended, at least by an active minority; they happened relatively suddenly, making the post-revolutionary stage readily distinguishable from the pre-revolutionary one; and they produced transformations in their respective societies which were lasting. Indeed, historians everywhere are turning to culture as a more inclusive descriptor of human activity than “politics” or “the economy” or “social relations,” all of which retain, of course, a prominent place in historical study.

But scientists have now unraveled many of the secrets of how successful conversations happen. They’ve learned that paying attention to someone’s body, alongside their voice, helps us hear them better. They have determined that how we ask a question sometimes matters more than what we ask. We’re better off, it seems, acknowledging social differences, rather than pretending they don’t exist. Every discussion is influenced by emotions, no matter how rational the topic at hand. When starting a dialogue, it helps to think of the discussion as a negotiation where the prize is figuring out what everyone wants. And, above all, the most important goal of any conversation is to connect.

The first one is that many discussions are actually three different conversations. There are practical, decision-making conversations that focus on What’s This Really About? There are emotional conversations, which ask How Do We Feel? And there are social conversations that explore Who Are We? We are often moving in and out of all three conversations as a dialogue unfolds. However, if we aren’t having the same kind of conversation as our partners, at the same moment, we’re unlikely to connect with each other.

​Finally, I learned much from my fellow Americans working at the NATO headquarters, however not all of the lessons were positive. Some of the members lived exclusively within the comforts of their government apartment: watching Armed Forces Network on TV, ordering delivered food and avoiding non-work-related journeys outside.  In short, they were “putting in time.” Not all Americans stationed abroad are there by choice, and like the force of gravity, Americans are pulled toward other Americans for dinners, movie nights and the National Football League. So, if one is not careful, you might find all of your weekends and free time spent in this insular American community, the expatriate community, on a cultural island totally isolated from the host country. Environments such as these build mental walls and reinforce the idea that an American is not meant to live or attempt to thrive in another culture. Certainly, I missed some aspects of American culture -- I had a strange nostalgia for flannel shirts while living in Turkey -- but my sense of adventure would not allow me to try and create a copy of my life in America.

Sympathy, therefore, does not arise so much from the view of the passion, as from that of the situation which excites it. We sometimes feel for another, a passion of which he himself seems to be altogether incapable; because, when we put ourselves in his case, that passion arises in our breast from the imagination, though it does not in his from the reality. We blush for the impudence and rudeness of another, though he himself appears to have no sense of the impropriety of his own behaviour; because we cannot help feeling with what confusion we ourselves should be covered, had we behaved in so absurd a manner.

Can they be used to deter any war between nuclear powers, or just nuclear use in those wars? In the event of war how might they be employed to gain a military advantage? To what extent does the credibility of deterrence depend on forms of effective and potentially decisive use being identified?

In his time there, Lawler learned that working for the CIA was essentially a communications job. A field officer’s mandate wasn’t slinking in shadows or whispering in parking lots; it was talking to people at parties, making friends in embassies, bonding with foreign officials in the hope that, someday, you might have a quiet chat about some critical piece of intelligence. Communication is so important that a summary of CIA training methods puts it right up front: “Find ways to connect,” it says. “A case officer’s goal should be to have a prospective agent come to believe, hopefully with good reason, that the case officer is one of the few people, perhaps the ONLY person, who truly understands him.”

But when Sievers looked at the data, he found that strong leaders didn’t help people align. In fact, groups with a dominant leader had the least amount of neural synchrony. Participant 4 made it harder for his groupmates to sync up. When he dominated the conversation, he pushed everyone else into their own, separate thoughts. Rather, the groups with the greatest synchrony had one or two people who behaved very differently from Participant 4. These people tended to speak less than dominant leaders, and when they did open their mouths, it was usually to ask questions. They repeated others’ ideas and were quick to admit their own confusion or make fun of themselves. They encouraged their groupmates (“That’s really smart! Tell me more about what you think!”) and laughed at others’ jokes. They didn’t stand out as particularly talkative or clever, but when they spoke, everyone listened closely. And, somehow, they made it easier for other people to speak up. They made conversations flow. Sievers began referring to these people as high centrality participants.

When Sievers looked at the lives of high centrality participants, he found they were unusual in other respects. They had much larger social networks than the average person and were more likely to be elected to positions of authority or entrusted with power. Other people turned to them when they needed to discuss something serious or ask for advice. “And that makes sense,” Sievers told me. “Because if you’re the kind of person who’s easy to talk to, then lots of people are going to want to talk to you.” In other words, the high centrality participants were supercommunicators.

Victor Frankl suggests that there are three central values in life—the experiential, or that which happens to us; the creative, or that which we bring into existence; and the attitudinal, or our response in difficult circumstances such as terminal illness. My own experience with people confirms the point Frankl makes—that the highest of the three values is attitudinal, in the paradigm or reframing sense. In other words, what matters most is how we respond to what we experience in life.

All of this advice has obvious merit, except, perhaps, for the emphasis on repetition. (If you have to tell someone the same thing ten times, the idea probably wasn’t very well designed. No urban legend has to be repeated ten times.)

PRINCIPLE 2: UNEXPECTEDNESS How do we get our audience to pay attention to our ideas, and how do we maintain their interest when we need time to get the ideas across? We need to violate people’s expectations. We need to be counterintuitive. A bag of popcorn is as unhealthy as a whole day’s worth of fatty foods! We can use surprise—an emotion whose function is to increase alertness and cause focus—to grab people’s attention. But surprise doesn’t last. For our idea to endure, we must generate interest and curiosity. How do you keep students engaged during the forty-eighth history class of the year? We can engage people’s curiosity over a long period of time by systematically “opening gaps” in their knowledge—and then filling those gaps.

PRINCIPLE 1: SIMPLICITY How do we find the essential core of our ideas? A successful defense lawyer says, “If you argue ten points, even if each is a good point, when they get back to the jury room they won’t remember any.” To strip an idea down to its core, we must be masters of exclusion. We must relentlessly prioritize. Saying something short is not the mission—sound bites are not the ideal. Proverbs are the ideal. We must create ideas that are both simple and profound. The Golden Rule is the ultimate model of simplicity: a one-sentence statement so profound that an individual could spend a lifetime learning to follow it.

PRINCIPLE 3: CONCRETENESS How do we make our ideas clear? We must explain our ideas in terms of human actions, in terms of sensory information. This is where so much business communication goes awry. Mission statements, synergies, strategies, visions—they are often ambiguous to the point of being meaningless. Naturally sticky ideas are full of concrete images—ice-filled bathtubs, apples with razors—because our brains are wired to remember concrete data. In proverbs, abstract truths are often encoded in concrete language: “A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.” Speaking concretely is the only way to ensure that our idea will mean the same thing to everyone in our audience.

PRINCIPLE 4: CREDIBILITY How do we make people believe our ideas? When the former surgeon general C. Everett Koop talks about a public-health issue, most people accept his ideas without skepticism. But in most day-to-day situations we don’t enjoy this authority. Sticky ideas have to carry their own credentials. We need ways to help people test our ideas for themselves—a “try before you buy” philosophy for the world of ideas. When we’re trying to build a case for something, most of us instinctively grasp for hard numbers. But in many cases this is exactly the wrong approach. In the sole U.S. presidential debate in 1980 between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, Reagan could have cited innumerable statistics demonstrating the sluggishness of the economy. Instead, he asked a simple question that allowed voters to test for themselves: “Before you vote, ask yourself if you are better off today than you were four years ago.”

PRINCIPLE 5: EMOTIONS How do we get people to care about our ideas? We make them feel something. In the case of movie popcorn, we make them feel disgusted by its unhealthiness. The statistic “37 grams” doesn’t elicit any emotions. Research shows that people are more likely to make a charitable gift to a single needy individual than to an entire impoverished region. We are wired to feel things for people, not for abstractions. Sometimes the hard part is finding the right emotion to harness. For instance, it’s difficult to get teenagers to quit smoking by instilling in them a fear of the consequences, but it’s easier to get them to quit by tapping into their resentment of the duplicity of Big Tobacco.

PRINCIPLE 6: STORIES How do we get people to act on our ideas? We tell stories. Firefighters naturally swap stories after every fire, and by doing so they multiply their experience; after years of hearing stories, they have a richer, more complete mental catalog of critical situations they might confront during a fire and the appropriate responses to those situations. Research shows that mentally rehearsing a situation helps us perform better when we encounter that situation in the physical environment. Similarly, hearing stories acts as a kind of mental flight simulator, preparing us to respond more quickly and effectively.

It’s hard to be a tapper. The problem is that tappers have been given knowledge (the song title) that makes it impossible for them to imagine what it’s like to lack that knowledge. When they’re tapping, they can’t imagine what it’s like for the listeners to hear isolated taps rather than a song. This is the Curse of Knowledge. Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has “cursed” us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because we can’t readily re-create our listeners’ state of mind. The tapper/listener experiment is reenacted every day across the world. The tappers and listeners are CEOs and frontline employees, teachers and students, politicians and voters, marketers and customers, writers and readers. All of these groups rely on ongoing communication, but, like the tappers and listeners, they suffer from enormous information imbalances. When a CEO discusses “unlocking shareholder value,” there is a tune playing in her head that the employees can’t hear.

Why can’t these smart, talented speakers make their ideas stick? A few of the villains discussed in this book are implicated. The first villain is the natural tendency to bury the lead—to get lost in a sea of information. One of the worst things about knowing a lot, or having access to a lot of information, is that we’re tempted to share it all. High school teachers will tell you that when students write research papers they feel obligated to include every unearthed fact, as though the value were in the quantity of data amassed rather than in its purpose or clarity. Stripping out information, in order to focus on the core, is not instinctual. The second villain is the tendency to focus on the presentation rather than on the message. Public speakers naturally want to appear composed, charismatic, and motivational. And, certainly, charisma will help a properly designed message stick better. But all the charisma in the world won’t save a dense, unfocused speech, as some Stanford students learn the hard way.

Think about the students who missed both a fantastic lecture and a great film because they couldn’t decide which one was better, or how hard it was for Jeff Hawkins, the leader of the Palm Pilot development group, to get his team to focus on a few issues rather than on many.

The SUCCESs checklist is a substitute for the framework above, and its advantage is that it’s more tangible and less subject to the Curse of Knowledge. In fact, if you think back across the chapters you’ve read, you’ll notice that the framework matches up nicely: 1. Pay attention: UNEXPECTED 2. Understand and remember it: CONCRETE 3. Agree/Believe: CREDIBLE 4. Care: EMOTIONAL 5. Be able to act on it: STORY So, rather than guess about whether people will understand our ideas, we should ask, “Is it concrete?” Rather than speculate about whether people will care, we should ask, “Is it emotional? Does it get out of Maslow’s basement? Does it force people to put on an Analytical Hat or allow them to feel empathy?” (By the way, “Simple” is not on the list above because it’s mainly about the Answer stage—honing in on the core of your message and making it as compact as possible.

This book is first and foremost a history of Indigenous peoples, but it is also a history of colonialism. The history of North America that emerges is of a place and an era shaped by warfare above all. The contest for the continent was, in essence, a four-centuries-long war that saw almost every Native nation fight encroaching colonial powers—sometimes in alliances, sometimes alone. Although the Indian wars in North America have been written about many times before, this book offers a broad Indigenous view of the conflict. For Native nations, war was often a last resort. In many cases, if not most, they attempted to bring Europeans into their fold, making them useful. These were not the actions of supplicants; the Europeans were the supplicants—their lives, movements, and ambitions determined by Native nations that drew the newcomers into their settlements and kinship networks, seeking trade and allies. Indian men and women alike were sophisticated diplomats, shrewd traders, and forceful leaders. The haughty Europeans assumed that the Indians were weak and uncivilized, only to find themselves forced to agree to humiliating terms—an inversion of common assumptions about White dominance and Indian dispossession that have survived to the present.

Indigenous Continent tells a different story. It offers a new account of American history by challenging the notion that colonial expansion was inevitable and that colonialism defined the continent, as well as the experiences of those living on it. Stepping outside of such outdated assumptions, this book reveals a world that remained overwhelmingly Indigenous well into the nineteenth century. It argues that rather than a “colonial America,” we should speak of an Indigenous America that was only slowly and unevenly becoming colonial. By 1776, various European colonial powers together claimed nearly all of the continent for themselves, but Indigenous peoples and powers controlled it. The maps in modern textbooks that paint much of early North America with neat, color-coded blocks confuse outlandish imperial claims for actual holdings. The history of the overwhelming and persisting Indigenous power recounted here remains largely unknown, and it is the biggest blind spot in common understandings of the American past. The reality of an Indigenous continent has remained obscure because European empires, and especially the United States, invested power in the state and its bureaucracy, whereas Native nations invested power in kinship. From the beginning, European arrivals judged Indians on European terms. Later historians did the same, focusing on state power as the driving force in America. Kinship could be a source of great power, and Indigenous nations possessed advanced political systems that allowed for flexible diplomacy and war-making, even if Euro-Americans often failed to see them. Time and again, and across centuries, Indians blocked and destroyed colonial projects, forcing Euro-Americans to accept Native ways, Native sovereignty, and Native dominance. This is what the historical record shows when American history is detached from mainstream historical narratives that privilege European ambitions, European perspectives, and European sources.

This book covers a vast span of history—four centuries and a continent—but it is given shape, direction, and meaning by a single theme: power. Here, power is defined as the ability of people and their communities to control space and resources, to influence the actions and perceptions of others, to hold enemies at bay, to muster otherworldly beings, and to initiate and resist change.

The most consequential exposure in North America took place in the Bering Strait, where, about seventy thousand years ago, a six-hundred-mile-wide landmass emerged to connect Asia and America. That swath of new land—Beringia—was scored by rivers, speckled with small lakes, and covered with grasses and shrubs that supported thriving animal communities, drawing people into America from the west.

The melting of glaciers started in North America roughly twenty-one thousand years ago. As the mile-high ice caps slowly melted into the oceans, a narrow ice-free corridor opened on the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains. Groups of people began moving southward through the passage around 11,000 BCE, eventually arriving in the great continental grasslands that were swarming with huge mammals: imperial mammoths, six-ton mastodons, eight-foot-tall bison, giant ground sloths, short-faced bears, camels, horses, and several species of antelope. The size and number of the beasts required technological innovation by the people now in the region, and groups of hunters began using flint, chert, obsidian, and other malleable stone to craft sharp-edged, fluted spear points that could penetrate a beast’s thick skin with lethal efficiency. Hunters would travel hundreds of miles to prime quarry sites to obtain the best stone. Lower-risk subsistence strategies—foraging, fishing, and hunting small game—rounded out diets, supporting growing and resilient human communities.

These and many other origin stories explain how a new multiethnic world—Indigenous America—took shape. The origin stories are not necessarily in conflict with some scientific theories about the peopling of the Americas. References to lands exposed during the ice age, and to the reemergence of dry land when glaciers began to melt, are not hard to detect in Indigenous origin stories. The ubiquitous floods—sudden, devastating, regenerative—in origin stories tell of the radical changes that humans faced in North America starting about 17,000 BCE. These stories illuminate an Indigenous America that is old, complex, and dynamic. The Pacific coast of Meso- and North America features 143 different Native languages, most likely the result of recurring splintering over thirty-five thousand years from a single original tongue.

Miscommunication occurs when people are having different kinds of conversations. If you are speaking emotionally, while I’m talking practically, we are, in essence, using different cognitive languages. (This explains why, when you complain about your boss—“Jim is driving me crazy!”—and your spouse responds with a practical suggestion—“What if you just invited him to lunch?”—it’s more apt to create conflict than connection: “I’m not asking you to solve this! I just want some empathy.”)

The importance of this insight—that communication comes from connection and alignment—is so fundamental that it has become known as the matching principle: Effective communication requires recognizing what kind of conversation is occurring, and then matching each other. On a very basic level, if someone seems emotional, allow yourself to become emotional as well. If someone is intent on decision making, match that focus. If they are preoccupied by social implications, reflect their fixation back to them.

He slowly became a better salesman. Not great, but better. “I learned that if you listen for someone’s truth, and you put your truth next to it, you might reach them.” His goal, during sales calls, became simply to connect.

The invention of the atlatl around 7500 BCE was a breakthrough. A wooden stick with a shaft on one end and a socket on the other, the atlatl enabled a thrower to propel a light spear faster and farther, with a flipping motion that channeled stored energy in a springlike effect. Essentially an extension of the hunter’s arm, the atlatl transformed hunting into a relatively safe and easy affair.

A true dietary revolution came later, with the arrival of maiz de ocho in the first millennium of our era. A major step in the long evolution of corn, the maiz de ocho variety was robust, adaptable, and easy to process. It flowered quickly, requiring less labor, and could withstand harsh weather. When farmers began growing beans and squash along with maiz de ocho some fifteen hundred years ago, they created an ecologically compatible triad of crops—the “three sisters”—that revolutionized food production and diets in North America.

By planting the three crops together, Indigenous farmers created a set of highly beneficial synergies. Corn’s tall and sturdy stalks provided a strong structure on which bean vines could climb. Corn’s high nutrient requirements could quickly deplete the soil of nitrogen, a vital ingredient in photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy that plants can use. Here farmers could rely on beans to help. Nodules on their roots have microbes that pull nitrogen from the air, convert it to a form that corn and squash can use, and return it to the soil as a natural fertilizer. As beans climb up the cornstalks toward the sun, squash provides essential protections: spreading near the ground, it offers shade with its broad leaves, helping the soil to retain moisture and deterring weeds, and its prickly hairs repel rodents and other pests. The outcome of this companion planting was a nearly ideal human diet: corn is rich in carbohydrates, whereas beans, especially when dried, yield plenty of protein, and together the three crops provide most essential vitamins and minerals.

In North America, leaders were not autocrats commanding and coercing subjects. They were instead arbitrators and facilitators striving for consensus. They did not seek to maximize personal power; they sought to maximize the number of their followers. Good leaders were poor. They accepted trade goods and gifts from allies, but to govern effectively they had to redistribute most of the goods among their people. Their reward was loyalty and expansive networks of fictive kinship that could extend to numerous allied nations. With few exceptions, this became the norm in North America. Kinship—an all-pervasive sense of relatedness and mutual obligations—became the central organizing principle for human life. Kinship was the crucial adhesive that kept people and nations linked together. It would be a mistake to see this adaptation as some kind of a failure or aberration of civilization, as European newcomers almost invariably did. North American Indians had experimented with ranked societies and all-powerful spiritual leaders and had found them deficient and dangerous. They had opted for more horizontal, participatory, and egalitarian ways of being in the world—a communal ethos available to everyone who was capable of proper thoughts and deeds and willing to share their possessions. Their ideal society was a boundless commonwealth that could be—at least in theory—extended to outsiders, infinitely

The contrast to the stunning Spanish successes in Middle and South America was striking: how could relatively small Native groups defy Spanish colonialism in the north when the formidable Aztec, Inca, and Maya Empires had fallen so easily? The answer was right in front of the Spanish—the decentralized, kinship-based, and egalitarian political regimes made poor targets for imperial entradas—but they kept missing it because the Indigenous nations were so different from Europe’s hierarchical societies. They also missed a fundamental fact about Indigenous warfare: fighting on their homelands, the Indians did not need to win battles and wars; they just needed not to lose them.

Far more powerful than most of the Indigenous confederacies that Europeans had encountered in North America, the Powhatans were ruled by a paramount leader, Wahunsenacawh, an ambitious and shrewd mamanatowick, a title that connoted manito, “spiritual power.” Wahunsenacawh had subdued numerous local weroances, extending his authority over more than thirty towns. He was a “keeper of many spirits” and commanded fifteen thousand people across a vast domain called Tsenacommacah, “densely inhabited land.” Residing in Werowocomoco—“king’s house”—the approximately sixty-year-old leader collected tribute from satellite groups and had about a hundred wives, the foundation of an expansive kinship network that held his empire together.

IMPERIAL RIVALRIES among the European powers exacerbated the tense situation in New England. More quietly than the Spanish, French, and English, the Dutch had entered the contest for North America in 1609, when Henry Hudson, having failed to find a sea route to China through North America, came to a river that still bears his name. When Dutch merchants arrived in the Hudson Valley in the 1610s, they realized it was a place of vast advantages. The Hudson was navigable for 160 miles into the interior, allowing access to bustling Native markets along the Saint Lawrence Valley and in the Great Lakes. Uninterested in converting and “civilizing” the Indians, the business-minded Dutch treated Indians as customers and trading partners. The Dutch Indian policy was persistently practical. Dutch merchants quickly determined where the power lay and acted accordingly, forging close ties with the Mahican Nation, which dominated the interior trade. The Dutch built Fort Nassau in 1614 on the Hudson and, through the Mahicans, sold guns, powder, and iron tools across an enormous hinterland. In return, Fort Nassau was flooded with beaver pelts, North America’s most coveted commodity, making a fortune for the Dutch. The fort had only about four dozen employees, half of them traders and the other half soldiers. This kind of light colonialism was not exactly by design—Dutch imperial ambitions in Asia drew most of the available resources—but the relative modesty of their operations in North America would serve the Dutch well.6 Dutch commercial prowess alarmed the English, triggering an unexpected imperial contest centered on processed clamshells.

Capitalizing on the Iroquois connection proved frustrating, though. The Mohawks of the Iroquois League attacked their Mahican rivals until they won a near monopoly on trade with Fort Orange. Dutch and Mohawk interests began to diverge, rendering the Dutch position unstable. The Mohawks allowed the Mahicans into Fort Orange only if they paid tribute to them, effectively turning the fort into a private Mohawk possession. Mohawk soldiers guarded the roads to the fort and decided who could enter. The role of Dutch traders was simply to make goods available—a task that the Mohawks monitored diligently. When the Dutch sought to open trade with the Mahicans, the Mohawks punished them. Soon there were killings on both sides. Mohawk soldiers vandalized the homes of wealthy Dutch landholders, killed Dutch cattle, and burned a Dutch ship in the harbor. In Dutch eyes, the Mohawks had transformed from customers into overlords. Humiliated Dutch colonists beat and kidnapped Mohawk leaders, only to further antagonize the Indian nation. When six Dutch traders joined a Mahican war party in 1626, Mohawks killed three of them and, as a warning, burned one of the bodies.

The Pequot and Raritan massacres, taking place six years apart, seemed to mark the sweeping collapse of Indigenous power in the Northeast. In truth, the massacres exposed a deep-rooted European anxiety over enduring Indigenous power: the attacks were so vicious because the colonists feared the Indians who refused to submit to their rule. The wars with the far more numerous and larger Native nations stretched the colonists near their breaking point. Native men were superior soldiers, having trained and prepared for war from a young age, internalizing an exacting warrior code that was drilled in by military societies. War was to them normal and suffused with spiritualism, whereas the European intruders struggled with the environment and the fluid nature of Indigenous warfare. Their farms and fields abutted Native homelands and hunting grounds, infusing everyday life with fears of reprisal. The Europeans also started losing their technological edge when independent traders violated colonial laws and began selling guns and munitions to their Native customers

Huddling in their small colonial enclaves, the English and Dutch were insular and powerless in comparison, managing little more than glimpses of the Indigenous politics that determined events and outcomes. The English thought they could regulate matters of war and peace in the New World, but more often than not, Indians steered them into fighting and financing Indian wars and facilitating truces and treaties with goods and gifts when the fighting stopped. The colonists—whether Spanish, French, English, or Dutch—could be arrogant and brutal, but the Indians had learned how to exploit them for their own purposes. Properly managed and manipulated, they could be useful.

The most effective communicators pause before they speak and ask themselves: Why am I opening my mouth? Unless we know what kind of discussion we’re hoping for—and what type of discussion our companions want—we’re at a disadvantage.

When a student comes to a teacher upset, for instance, the teacher might ask: “Do you want to be helped, hugged, or heard?” Different needs require different types of communication, and those different kinds of interaction—helping, hugging, hearing—each correspond to a different kind of conversation.

According to Winthrop, God had cleared the land of savages, securing America for a worthier race. Winthrop was half-right; there might have been no New England—indeed no English colonies—in North America without this biological catastrophe. The death zone extended from the Atlantic coast to the Appalachians and from the Chesapeake Bay to the Saint Lawrence Valley, destroying countless Native communities. Yet regardless of Winthrop’s conviction of divine partiality, nothing in North America was preordained. The same epidemic that seemed to offer the English an entire new world also triggered the most explosive Indigenous expansion since the first migrations across the length of the hemisphere. The Iroquois League, having lost nearly half of its members, went to war to repopulate itself by making Iroquois out of others.

The Iroquois had driven thousands of people into the west, gaining a vast domain in their wake. It was the first large-scale westward expansion in early American history. But this did not put an end to the warfare, which only seemed to escalate as the Iroquois’s enemies dispersed. The explanation was at once simple and unique: the Iroquois needed people more than they needed territory

A Dutch pastor wrote that “the Principal nation of all the savages and Indians hereabouts with which we have the most intercourse is the Mahakuaas [Mohawks], who have laid all the other Indians near us under contribution.” The Iroquois refused to accept English and Dutch currencies in commercial transactions and insisted on the use of wampum beads instead.

Often, what people desire from a negotiation isn’t obvious at first. Sometimes a union leader might say her goal is higher wages. But then, over time, other goals are revealed: She also wants to look good to her members, or one union faction hopes to take power from another faction, or the workers value autonomy on a par with higher paychecks, but they don’t know how to express that at the bargaining table. It can take time, and the right inquiries, to help define people’s desires. So an important task in any negotiation is asking lots of questions.

He hadn’t been asking the right questions. He hadn’t been asking about their needs and desires, what they wanted from this conversation. He had assumed he already knew. And because he hadn’t bothered to figure out what mattered, he had deluged patients with information they didn’t care about. He resolved to change how he communicated, to stop lecturing and start asking better questions, to begin having proper dialogues.

However, Boly is also different in another, less obvious way: He’s a supercommunicator. He knows he must figure out what each juror wants from this discussion, what they need, and he knows that requires, as a first step, asking lots of questions. So he starts posing them as the conversation moves around the room: What do you think of handguns? What did you think when Leroy got flummoxed? Do you own a gun? Can we talk about what “possession” means? What is justice? To the other jurors, these questions seem innocent, almost like casual asides. But Boly is listening closely to how people answer, cataloging each juror in his mind, trying to figure out what each person wants to discuss. Some want to talk about morality and fairness (“I don’t care what the law says. Has justice been done?”) or autonomy (“I am not a computer…. I want to sit here and talk about it and think about it and not just say, right off the bat, he’s convicted on these three counts, he’s therefore guilty”) or are simply bored (“We can argue about semantics and we could do that forever”).

Until then, many people had assumed that negotiations were zero-sum games: Any time I gained something at the bargaining table, you lost. “A generation ago,” reads Getting to Yes, “in contemplating a negotiation, the common question in people’s minds was, ‘Who is going to win and who is going to lose?’ ” But Fisher, a Harvard law professor, thought that approach was all wrong. As a young man, he had helped implement the Marshall Plan in Europe and, later, aided in finding ways to end the Vietnam War. He had worked on the Camp David Accords in 1978 and in securing the release of fifty-two American hostages from Iran in 1981. In those and other negotiations, Fisher saw something different at work: The best negotiators didn’t battle over who should get the biggest slice of pie. Rather, they focused on making the pie itself larger, finding win-win solutions where everyone walked away happier than before. The concept that both sides could “win” in a negotiation, Fisher and his colleagues wrote, might seem impossible, but “it is increasingly recognized that there are cooperative ways of negotiating our differences and that even if a ‘win-win’ solution cannot be found, a wise agreement can still often be reached that is better for both sides.” Since Getting to Yes was first published, hundreds of studies have found ample evidence to support this idea.

This approach has become known as interest-based bargaining, and its first step looks a lot like what Boly did in the jury room or what Dr. Ehdaie did with his patients at Sloan Kettering: Ask open-ended questions and listen closely. Get people talking about how they see the world and what they value most. Even if you don’t learn, right away, what others are seeking—they might not know themselves—you’ll at least inspire them to listen back. “If you want the other side to appreciate your interests,” Fisher wrote, “begin by demonstrating that you appreciate theirs.”

There’s a lesson here: The first step of a quiet negotiation is figuring out what people want from a conversation. The second step is determining how we’re going to make choices together—and that means deciding if this is a rational conversation or an empathetic one. Are we going to make decisions through analysis and reason, or through empathy and narratives?

Boly and Ehdaie understood that matching isn’t mimicry; it’s not simply looking concerned and repeating back what others have said. Rather, matching is understanding someone’s mindset—what kind of logic they find persuasive, what tone and approach makes sense to them—and then speaking their language. And it requires explaining clearly how we, ourselves, are thinking and making choices, so that others can match us in return. When someone describes a personal problem by telling a story, they are signaling they want our compassion rather than a solution. When they lay out all the facts analytically, they are signaling they are more interested in a rational conversation than an emotional one. We can all learn to get better at noticing these clues and conducting the experiments that reveal them.

Researchers at Harvard and other universities have looked at exactly which kind of prep work is helpful. Participants in one study were asked to jot down a few topics they would like to discuss before a conversation began. This exercise took only about thirty seconds; frequently the topics written down never came up once the discussion started. But simply preparing a list, researchers found, made conversations go better. There were fewer awkward pauses, less anxiety, and, afterward, people said they felt more engaged. So, in the moments before a conversation starts, it’s useful to describe for yourself: What are two topics you might discuss? (Being general is okay: Last night’s game and TV shows you like) What is one thing you hope to say? What is one question you will ask?

Sometimes, we want others to go first. The easiest way to do that is by asking open-ended questions, just as Dr. Ehdaie did with his patients. And open-ended questions are easy to find, if you focus on: Asking about someone’s beliefs or values (“How’d you decide to become a teacher?”) Asking someone to make a judgment (“Are you glad you went to law school?”) Asking about someone’s experiences (“What was it like to visit Europe?”)

how the other person responds is important, and so we need to train ourselves to notice what might go unsaid. Some important things to pay attention to: Do your companions lean toward you, make eye contact, smile, backchannel (“Interesting,” “Hmm”), or interrupt? Those are signals they want to accept your invitation. (Interruptions, contrary to expectations, usually mean people want to add something.) Do they become quiet, their expressions passive, their eyes fixed somewhere besides your face? Do they seem overly contemplative? Do they take in your comments without adding thoughts of their own? People often misperceive these responses as listening. But they usually aren’t. (In fact, as the next few chapters explain, listening is much more active.) These are signals that someone is declining our invitation and wants to talk about something else—in which case, you need to keep searching—and experimenting—to learn what everyone wants.

Now, as an adult, Epley wondered if the psychology textbooks had it wrong. Perhaps the correct approach wasn’t trying to put yourself in “someone else’s shoes.” That, after all, was impossible. Rather, maybe the best you can do is ask questions.

Questions about facts (“Where do you live?” “What college did you attend?”) are often conversational dead-ends. They don’t draw out values or experiences. They don’t invite vulnerability. However, those same inquiries, recast slightly (“What do you like about where you live?” “What was your favorite part of college?”), invite others to share their preferences, beliefs, and values, and to describe experiences that caused them to grow or change. Those questions make emotional replies easier, and they practically beg the questioner to reciprocate—to divulge, in return, why they live in this neighborhood, what they enjoyed about college—until everyone is drawn in, asking and answering back and forth. “It might seem hard to reframe questions in a way that’s vulnerable,” Epley told me. “But it’s actually pretty easy once you start looking for it. Like when I’m on a train, talking with people commuting to work, I might ask them, ‘What do you do for a living?’ And then I might say, ‘Do you love that job?’ or ‘Do you have something else you dream of doing?’ And right there, you’re two questions in, and you’ve gotten to somebody’s dreams.”

This is how to ask emotional questions in the real world: Ask someone how they feel about something, and then follow up with questions that reveal how you feel. It’s the same framework for emotional connection described before, but in a slightly different guise: If we ask questions that push people to think and talk about their values, beliefs, and experiences, and then reciprocate with emotions of our own, we can’t help but listen to one another. “The best listeners aren’t just listening,” said Margaret Clark, the Yale psychologist. “They’re triggering emotions by asking questions, expressing their own emotions, doing things that prompt the other person to say something real.”

AROUND 1680, ABOUT FIFTY YEARS after the terrible smallpox epidemic that cut their numbers by half, the Five Nations were at the height of their power; they were now the domineering nation in the great interior. The French feared them, the English respected them as allies, and the Dutch no longer had a colony in North America. The Iroquois seemed to be everywhere. Their fleet-footed war parties ranged across the Great Lakes, seeking captives, pelts, and spiritual and emotional healing. Their world had expanded explosively, covering a massive domain. They seized pelts and captives from the Ottawa Valley to the western limits of the pays d’en haut, which the French still claimed—feebly now—as part of their empire. With most English colonies now in their orbit, the Five Nations moved to draw their Native neighbors within their sphere of influence.

The Five Nations blended diplomacy, intimidation, and violence as the circumstances dictated, creating a measured instability that only they could navigate.

Greater resources are not what gave the Five Nations their advantage; rather, they overpowered New France by being more creative and more nimble. Born of chaos and terror, the Great League of Peace and Power was both conciliatory and inclusive. All league-wide decisions were based on consensus, but at the local level the league was nearly a pure meritocracy. A skillful and powerful local leader with many supporters could launch attacks, wage war, and make and break truces virtually at will. He could take war parties into enemy settlements to seize captives, force hunting privileges, and protect trade outlets. The Iroquois showed two faces to colonial powers. One was that of a sophisticated league with whom one could negotiate, conduct trade, and coexist. The other was that of a military power—forceful, decentralized, unpredictable, uncontainable.

The Seven Council Fires had maneuvered for decades to gain access to the fur trade that delivered crucial technology and allies to other Native nations, but their efforts had yielded little beyond a tenuous connection with the Sauteurs who occupied a resource-rich peninsula at the southwestern corner of Lake Superior, a strip of land the French called La Pointe du Chequamegon.

Gradually, one encounter at a time, they forged an extraordinary common world, a middle ground, where they could coexist as allies and equals. Born of weakness, the middle ground was a social space where people accepted their mutual dependency. Too weak to dictate, they had to accommodate one another. Much of the accommodation required appealing to the cultural norms and customs of the other—customs that often seemed absurd and outright repulsive. It could be more useful to be creatively misunderstood than to be perfectly understood: from those misunderstandings arose new meanings and practices, the sinews of the middle ground. The apogee of the French-Indian accommodation was the Feast of the Dead, an ancient ceremony in which a host nation sponsored a mass reburial of the bones of the departed and distributed massive amounts of gifts to ease the pain and create new relatives and allies.11

In the middle ground, Perrot and other French officials arbitrated quarrels and sponsored Indigenous rituals that kept the world in balance, and soon new ways of coexisting emerged. Rather than imposing their own norms and values, they had to find something in an alien culture that could be used, appropriated, and repurposed, however odd or abhorrent it might be. One concession and one expedient misreading at a time, Native Americans and newcomers began shading into one another—a prime manifestation of Indigenous pragmatism.14

In Quebec, the French governor commanded an empire with an iron grip, but on the middle ground he was Onontio—generous, forgiving, and loving. He was expected to care for his Native allies—his symbolic children—and give gifts, not orders. The most elemental human desires—sex, procreation, and the need for companionship—gave the middle ground depth and staying power. Those needs were dramatically intensified in the pays d’en haut by the fact that very few Frenchwomen accompanied their husbands into what the French thought was a wilderness. Apart from the Jesuits, most Frenchmen sought sexual relations and marriages with Native women, who had their own reasons to favorably respond to being courted by the French: marriages with traders opened access to crucial goods and could dramatically enhance the standing of the women’s families. Native women who married fur traders often became mediators between the French and Indians and built extensive kinship networks through the Catholic institution of godparenting, expanding and solidifying the middle ground. Some women who married traders assumed important roles in their communities as religious educators. Marie Rouensa-8cate8a, who was from a prominent Illini family, married a French fur trader, converted to Catholicism, and moved into the grand village of Kaskaskia, where she translated a Jesuit tract into the Kaskaskia language, becoming a leader in her community.18

In the first act, called the “read era,” circa 1990 to 2005, early internet protocol networks democratized information. Anyone could type a few words into a web browser and read about almost any topic through websites. In the second act, the “read-write era,” roughly 2006 to 2020, corporate networks democratized publishing. Anyone could write and publish to mass audiences through posts on social networks and other services. Now a new type of architecture is enabling the internet’s third act. This architecture represents a natural synthesis of the two prior types, and it is democratizing ownership. In the dawning “read-write-own era,” anyone can become a network stakeholder, gaining power and economic upside previously enjoyed by only a small number of corporate affiliates, like stockholders and employees. This new era promises to counteract Big Tech consolidation and return the internet to its dynamic roots. People can read and write on the internet, but they can also now own.

Metcalfe’s law, one well-known formulation of the network effect, stipulates that the value of a network grows quadratically, meaning proportional to the number of nodes squared (that is, raising by an exponent of 2). For the mathematically minded, a network with ten nodes would be twenty-five times as valuable as a network with two nodes, while a network with a hundred nodes would be a hundred times as valuable as one with ten nodes, and so on. The law takes its name from Robert Metcalfe, a co-creator of Ethernet and the electronics maker 3Com who popularized the idea in the 1980s.

Users could then bring their connections wherever they like, and they could read and post content across networks according to their preferences.

If you change how you speak, there’s a risk other people won’t understand you. You cease to interoperate, in tech vernacular.

These dynamics explain why email, namely newsletter writing, is having a renaissance among so many content creators. Email gives creators a direct relationship with their audiences, unmediated by central network operators who can change the economics, access rules, or content rankings on a whim. If newsletter services like Substack, which layer on top of email, were to change the rules or the rates, users could simply leave and take their subscribers with them. (Many of these services currently let users export email subscriber lists.) The ability to exit lowers switching costs and, therefore, take rates. That’s the power of decoupling names from services in protocol networks.

Some open-source projects are well funded because their success aligns with the interests of big companies. The most widely used operating system in the world, Linux, falls into this category. Companies that benefit from the proliferation of open-source operating systems, like IBM, Intel, and Google, support Linux development. But building new protocol networks generally doesn’t align with corporate interests. Indeed, the strategy of most tech companies is to capture, control, and monopolize networks. The last thing they would want to do is fund a potential competitor. Protocol networks are in the collective interest of the internet, but the internet hasn’t had a significant source of direct funding since the government bankrolled it in the early days. Protocol networks like email and the web succeeded because they arrived before serious alternatives. The incentives they created led to a golden period of creativity and innovation that persists to this day, despite the encroachment of Big Tech. But later attempts to build protocol networks have failed to go mainstream. The decline of RSS epitomizes the challenges protocol networks face. RSS’s cautionary tale also shows how protocol networks planted the seeds for a newer, more competitive network design, one that would define the next era of the internet.

Contrasting understandings of what counted as property exacerbated the conflict: the English insisted that they owned their farm animals even when they strayed and ravaged Native fields, but the Indians argued that such animals were fair game and could be killed and consumed at will. The Indians insisted that only dead animals could be owned, and they kept killing the invading strays. The Indians also sought compensation for the damages to their crops in colonial courts, but they received restitution only rarely. In the end, they had no choice but to accept fences and private ownership of the land and of animals as facts. Fences had ushered in a new order. The Indians were in danger of becoming strangers in their own land. The colonists, too, were angry and concerned: in their minds, there could not be colonialism without domestic animals.

Sets of instructions, called programs, specify how to take one state, an input, and produce a new state, an output. I like to describe computing through the lens of language, since more people can read and write than can program. Imagine nouns represent state or memory: things that can be manipulated.

In fact, everything that happens on popular blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum is public and traceable. As with email, you can sign up using a fake identity, but there are companies that specialize in de-anonymizing, and it’s straightforward for law enforcement to do so. Blockchains are so public by default that their innate transparency could actually hinder adoption. This may seem counterintuitive, given the erroneous public perception of crypto as a black box, but it’s true. People may be reluctant to use blockchains for certain activities if they fear doing so will expose sensitive information, such as salaries, medical bills, or invoices. Some projects are working to solve this problem by giving users the option to make transactions private.

Third and most important, blockchains can make strong commitments about their future behavior—that any code they run will continue to operate as designed. Traditional computers can’t make commitments like these. Traditional computers are controlled by individuals or groups of people, either directly, in the case of personal computers, or indirectly, in the case of corporate computers. Their commitments are weak. Blockchains invert this relationship, putting the code in charge. The consensus mechanism described earlier and the immutability of their software makes blockchains resistant to human intervention.

We can assert all this with some confidence because we still occasionally encounter islands of deep time today—in those moments when, to quote the writer Gary Eberle, we slip “into a realm where there is enough of everything, where we are not trying to fill a void in ourselves or the world.” The boundary separating the self from the rest of reality grows blurry, and time stands still. “The clock does not stop, of course,” Eberle writes, “but we do not hear it ticking.” This happens for some people in prayer, or in meditation, or in magnificent landscapes; I’m pretty sure my toddler son spent the whole of his infancy in such a state and is only now beginning to leave it.

The Industrial Revolution is usually attributed to the invention of the steam engine; but as Mumford shows in his 1934 magnum opus, Technics and Civilization, it also probably couldn’t have happened without the clock. By the late 1700s, rural peasants were streaming into English cities, taking jobs in mills and factories, each of which required the coordination of hundreds of people, working fixed hours, often six days a week, to keep the machines running

I remember sitting on a park bench near my home in Brooklyn one winter morning in 2014, feeling even more anxious than usual about the volume of undone tasks, and suddenly realizing that none of this was ever going to work. I would never succeed in marshaling enough efficiency, self-discipline, and effort to force my way through to the feeling that I was on top of everything, that I was fulfilling all my obligations and had no need to worry about the future. Ironically, the realization that this had been a useless strategy for attaining peace of mind brought me some immediate peace of mind. (After all, once you become convinced that something you’ve been attempting is impossible, it’s a lot harder to keep on berating yourself for failing.) What I had yet to understand, at that point, was why all these methods were doomed to fail, which was that I was using them to try to obtain a feeling of control over my life that would always remain out of reach.

But then the tide turned. The New England Confederation launched a joint campaign against the Indigenous armies, mobilizing their citizens, their god, and, most important, their Indian allies for a holy war that would see the righteous prevail over the Native “marauders” and “beasts.” The colonists convinced loyal mission Indians and Mohawks to join them with lavish gift-giving, and they abandoned the rigid European ways of waging war in favor of fluid Indigenous tactics that relied on ambushes, tactical retreats, dispersions, and individual marksmanship.

When it comes to blockchains, a key simplifying concept is units of ownership called tokens. While people often think of tokens as digital assets or currencies, a more accurate technical definition would describe them as data structures that can track quantities, permissions, and other metadata for users on a blockchain. If that sounds abstract, that’s because tokens are an abstraction. This abstraction makes them easy to use and simple to program. Tokens encapsulate complicated code into an uncomplicated wrapper, just like an electrical outlet.

Google, Amazon, and other big companies were disrupters in their early days, when they were in the attract phase. Today, in their extract phase, they’re focused on squeezing as much revenue as they can out of the networks they own. Thus, corporate network owners not only suck up almost all network revenue, but they find ways to extract additional fees on top of that. Network participants get left high and dry. They spend years cultivating followings; then the rules change, and they are forced to pay even more to reach the audiences they built.

Blockchain networks can avoid this fate if they can guarantee that users retain the credible threat of switching front-end clients even if users cluster around a few popular ones. To ensure this, the network must be designed to include the following: ■ Low-friction user experiences that match those of modern corporate networks. This is why blockchain networks need a mechanism for funding much of what corporate networks fund, including ongoing software development and user subsidies like free hosting and name registration. Protocol networks never had a sufficient funding mechanism, a key reason RSS failed. (See “Building Networks with Token Incentives” for more on blockchain funding mechanisms.) ■ Network effects that accrue to community-controlled blockchains rather than to company-controlled front-end applications. This means the things users care about—their names, social relationships, and digital goods—need to be blockchain-based and user owned. Applications are unable to acquire pricing leverage if users can easily switch from one application to another. When users own what matters, lock-in is much less likely.

It’s telling that the most successful protocol networks were funded by government programs in the 1970s and 1980s, before the arrival of the commercial internet. Email and the web prospered absent corporate network competition. To quote The Cluetrain Manifesto, a book published in 2000 that describes how the internet had changed business (and much else): “The Net grew like a weed between the cracks in the monolithic steel-and-glass empire of traditional commerce.” The internet flourished, the authors continue, “largely because it was ignored.”

Over the years, people have tried repeatedly to start a grassroots telecom service. Students at MIT (Roofnet), employees at a venture-funded startup (Fon), and neighbors in New York City (NYC Mesh) all took a crack at the challenge, and they all learned how hard it can be to install a sufficient number of access points for broad network coverage. Most projects stalled at the bootstrap phase. That is, until one. An experimental blockchain project, Helium, got further than anyone else. The network encouraged people to install and run access points in exchange for token rewards, enabling it to reach nationwide coverage in a few years. The project still has lots of work to do to build out the demand side of the network. (The initial network was based on an esoteric networking standard, but it has since upgraded to 5G cellular, a much more popular option.) But Helium built the supply side of the network for a grassroots telecom service much more successfully than previous attempts—proof of token incentives’ potential.

Blockchain networks depend on community-led evangelism, not advertising. This allows them to grow without having to pay Big Tech gatekeepers. Bitcoin and Ethereum don’t have companies behind them, let alone marketing budgets, and yet tens of millions of people own their tokens. Evangelists use word of mouth. They organize meetups, chat online, trade memes, and write posts. The same happens with many other networks. Almost none of the top blockchain networks have spent materially on advertising.

Gartner’s model builds on the work of other thinkers, like the economist Joseph Schumpeter, known for his theory of creative destruction. The model illustrates how when a new technology arrives, the excitement it generates can catalyze a financial bubble (the peak of inflated expectations). A crash usually follows (the trough of disillusionment). Then there’s a long period of productive growth as the technology gets broadly deployed (the slope of enlightenment).

The problem with informal governance is that rules and leaders inevitably emerge, but they are usually a product of inscrutable social dynamics rather than thoughtful design. The feminist author Jo Freeman calls this “the tyranny of structurelessness.” In her 1972 essay of the same name, she describes how hidden, unaccountable hierarchies form within supposedly leaderless organizations. When you create formal rules, you can debate them, learn from them, and improve them. (This is also why when tech startups experiment with “holacracy” and other structureless management styles, it almost never ends well.)

The carnage that the English exacted on the Native Americans was a sign of weakness, not strength. The Puritans had lived in fear of the Indians, conscious of the fact that the Indians knew the landscape better and could outfight them everywhere, whether in swamps, the woods, and even their own towns. Long before the shocking war, the Puritans had been obsessively concerned with the state of their souls, and their anxiety only intensified at war’s end. Their slaughter of Native women and children, mutilation of Indian bodies, and sheer hatred and rage shook the colonists’ view of themselves as civilized people. New England as a whole seemed to be slipping into savagery, its moral rot confirmed by the heathens’ victories on the battlefield.

THE NEARLY SIMULTANEOUS Indigenous rebellions against European imperial ambitions in all regions of North America at the end of the seventeenth century brought English, French, and Spanish colonists near their breaking points. Shockingly, Native Americans had rolled colonialism back in different corners of the continent, forcing colonists to retreat, recalibrate their ambitions, and reconsider their ingrained ideas about Native peoples. The Europeans suffered a crisis of self-confidence. Traumatized New Englanders, consumed by Indian wars, believed that their god was displeased with them. They turned against one other, denouncing neighbors, relatives, and those who were generally suspect as witches. Virginians, unable to decide what to do or how to live with their Native neighbors, fell into a civil war that nearly pulled the colony to pieces. New France, once the most promising of the colonial ventures, found its expansive sphere of influence in the interior dramatically reduced in the shadow of the ascending Five Nations League. In New Mexico, Spanish colonists entered into a tense, postrebellion accommodation with the Pueblos—an imperial retreat that instilled a softer edge on Spanish colonial rule.

Let’s pretend the top five social networks charged a similar amount. If they all had take rates of 10 percent, their share of the $150 billion in annual revenue would drop from $130 billion to $15 billion. That would put into the pockets of network participants such as creators an extra $115 billion per year. How many lives might that change? At the average U.S. salary of $59,000 per year, that extra $115 billion of redirected revenue could fund almost two million jobs. This is a rough estimate, but the numbers are clearly big. Low take rates have a multiplier effect. More money to the edges of the network means more people reach an income level where they can pursue creative work full-time. The two-tier class system that divides creators and users on most social networks would become more permeable.

There were many such maps in the Piedmont and elsewhere in North America—maps that kept the invaders out and taught newcomers how to behave. Colonies had to bend around Indigenous borders, rather than vice versa. Although Europeans had planted themselves on the Eastern Seaboard and along several major rivers from the Saint Lawrence to the Rio Grande, Native Americans controlled ninety percent of the continent, including most of the lands claimed by the British, French, and Spanish Empires, having fought several wars to keep them at arm’s length.

One European traveler reported that “our Landlord was King of the Kadapau Indians, and always kept two or three trading Girls in his Cabin. Offering one of these to some of our Company, who refused his Kindness, his Majesty flew into a violent Passion, to be thus slighted, telling the Englishmen that they were good for nothing.” The Europeans missed the crucial element of the practice: the creation of all-important kinship ties through intimacy. Around the same time, the great southeastern Indigenous confederacies—the Cherokees, Choctaws, and Muscogees—began to self-identify as people separate from the Whites. To distance themselves from the colonists geographically, the Catawbas denied them kinship. Continuing a centuries-long process, Cherokees, Choctaws, Chickasaws, Muscogees, and Catawbas were teaching the European newcomers how to treat the continent’s Native inhabitants and educating them about proper behavior, boundaries, and how to think and speak properly—a process that had begun with Cabeza de Vaca nearly three centuries before.

Unmarried women possessed complete autonomy, and many chose to enter into marriages with Carolina traders to secure steady access to goods for their families. By doing so, they stabilized potentially fraught commercial transactions between Indians and Whites through kinship, while shrewdly challenging European gender roles: Cherokee women could become “war women” who went to battle. When Muscogee soldiers planned to attack a group of colonists around 1700, Sophia Durant, a member of the authoritative Wind Clan, rode to the Muscogee town of Otciapofa and summoned its leaders.

In late 1716, the Muscogee national council sent ambassadors to New York to ask the Iroquois to intervene. With calculated bravado, the ambassadors announced that they represented “50 Nations of Indians.” Impressed, the Iroquois dispatched twenty ambassadors to accompany the delegation home. A year later, Muscogee ambassadors traveled on a Spanish ship from Pensacola in Florida to Veracruz in Mexico, and then to Mexico City, where they won an audience with Baltasar de Zúñiga y Guzmán, the viceroy of New Spain.

The reason for this effect is straightforward: the more firmly you believe it ought to be possible to find time for everything, the less pressure you’ll feel to ask whether any given activity is the best use for a portion of your time. Whenever you encounter some potential new item for your to-do list or your social calendar, you’ll be strongly biased in favor of accepting it, because you’ll assume you needn’t sacrifice any other tasks or opportunities in order to make space for it. Yet because in reality your time is finite, doing anything requires sacrifice—the sacrifice of all the other things you could have been doing with that stretch of time. If you never stop to ask yourself if the sacrifice is worth it, your days will automatically begin to fill not just with more things, but with more trivial or tedious things, because they’ve never had to clear the hurdle of being judged more important than something else. Commonly, these will be things that other people want you to do, to make their lives easier, and which you didn’t think to try to resist.

I’m embarrassed to admit what an outsize negative effect such minor frustrations have had on my happiness over the years. Fairly often, they still do; but the effect was worst at the height of my productivity geekhood, because when you’re trying to Master Your Time, few things are more infuriating than a task or delay that’s foisted upon you against your will, with no regard for the schedule you’ve painstakingly drawn up in your overpriced notebook. But when you turn your attention instead to the fact that you’re in a position to have an irritating experience in the first place, matters are liable to look very different indeed.

Here the story ends—but it’s a lie. The smug teacher is being dishonest. He has rigged his demonstration by bringing only a few big rocks into the classroom, knowing they’ll all fit into the jar. The real problem of time management today, though, isn’t that we’re bad at prioritizing the big rocks. It’s that there are too many rocks—and most of them are never making it anywhere near that jar. The critical question isn’t how to differentiate between activities that matter and those that don’t, but what to do when far too many things feel at least somewhat important, and therefore arguably qualify as big rocks.

The second principle is to limit your work in progress. Perhaps the most appealing way to resist the truth about your finite time is to initiate a large number of projects at once; that way, you get to feel as though you’re keeping plenty of irons in the fire and making progress on all fronts. Instead, what usually ends up happening is that you make progress on no fronts—because each time a project starts to feel difficult, or frightening, or boring, you can bounce off to a different one instead. You get to preserve your sense of being in control of things, but at the cost of never finishing anything important

Buffett’s advice is different: he tells the man to make a list of the top twenty-five things he wants out of life and then to arrange them in order, from the most important to the least. The top five, Buffett says, should be those around which he organizes his time. But contrary to what the pilot might have been expecting to hear, the remaining twenty, Buffett allegedly explains, aren’t the second-tier priorities to which he should turn when he gets the chance. Far from it. In fact, they’re the ones he should actively avoid at all costs—because they’re the ambitions insufficiently important to him to form the core of his life yet seductive enough to distract him from the ones that matter most.

This was why Seneca, in On the Shortness of Life, came down so hard on his fellow Romans for pursuing political careers they didn’t really care about, holding elaborate banquets they didn’t especially enjoy, or just “baking their bodies in the sun”: they didn’t seem to realize that in succumbing to such diversions, they were squandering the very stuff of existence. Seneca risks sounding like an uptight pleasure-hater here—after all, what’s so bad about a bit of sunbathing?—and to be honest, I suspect he probably was. But the crucial point isn’t that it’s wrong to choose to spend your time relaxing, whether at the beach or on BuzzFeed. It’s that the distracted person isn’t really choosing at all. Their attention has been commandeered by forces that don’t have their highest interests at heart.

The classic and extreme demonstration of this is the case of the Austrian psychotherapist Viktor Frankl, author of Man’s Search for Meaning, who was able to fend off despair as a prisoner in Auschwitz because he retained the ability to direct a portion of his attention toward the only domain the camp guards couldn’t violate: his inner life, which he was then able to conduct with a measure of autonomy, resisting the outer pressures that threatened to reduce him to the status of an animal. But the flip side of this inspiring truth is that a life spent in circumstances immeasurably better than a concentration camp can still end up feeling fairly meaningless if you’re incapable of directing some of your attention as you’d like.

They’re just the places we go to seek relief from the discomfort of confronting limitation. The reason it’s hard to focus on a conversation with your spouse isn’t that you’re surreptitiously checking your phone beneath the dinner table. On the contrary, “surreptitiously checking your phone beneath the dinner table” is what you do because it’s hard to focus on the conversation—because listening takes effort and patience and a spirit of surrender, and because what you hear might upset you, so checking your phone is naturally more pleasant.

I wish I could reveal, at this point, the secret for uprooting the urge toward distraction—the way to have it not feel unpleasant to decide to hold your attention, for a sustained time, on something you value, or that you can’t easily choose not to do. But the truth is that I don’t think there is one. The most effective way to sap distraction of its power is just to stop expecting things to be otherwise—to accept that this unpleasantness is simply what it feels like for finite humans to commit ourselves to the kinds of demanding and valuable tasks that force us to confront our limited control over how our lives unfold

“Trying to control the future is like trying to take the master carpenter’s place,” cautions one of the founding texts of Taoism, the Tao Te Ching, in a warning echoed several centuries later by the Buddhist scholar Geshe Shawopa, who gruffly commanded his students, “Do not rule over imaginary kingdoms of endlessly proliferating possibilities.” Jesus says much the same thing in the Sermon on the Mount (though many of his later followers would interpret the Christian idea of eternal life as a reason to fixate on the future, not to ignore it). “Take no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself,” he advises. Then he adds the celebrated phrase “sufficient to the day is the evil thereof,” a line I’ve only ever been able to hear in a tone of wry amusement directed at his listeners: Do you first-century working-class Galileans really lead such problem-free lives, he seems to be teasing them, that it makes sense to invent additional problems by fretting about what might happen tomorrow?

One way of understanding capitalism, in fact, is as a giant machine for instrumentalizing everything it encounters—the earth’s resources, your time and abilities (or “human resources”)—in the service of future profit. Seeing things this way helps explain the otherwise mysterious truth that rich people in capitalist economies are often surprisingly miserable.

To the philosophers of the ancient world, leisure wasn’t the means to some other end; on the contrary, it was the end to which everything else worth doing was a means. Aristotle argued that true leisure—by which he meant self-reflection and philosophical contemplation—was among the very highest of virtues because it was worth choosing for its own sake, whereas other virtues, like courage in war, or noble behavior in government, were virtuous only because they led to something else. The Latin word for business, negotium, translates literally as “not-leisure,” reflecting the view that work was a deviation from the highest human calling. In this understanding of the situation, work might be an unavoidable necessity for certain people—above all, for the slaves whose toil made possible the leisure of the citizens of Athens and Rome—but it was fundamentally undignified, and certainly not the main point of being alive.

Social psychologists call this inability to rest “idleness aversion,” which makes it sound like just another minor behavioral foible; but in his famous theory of the “Protestant work ethic,” the German sociologist Max Weber argued that it was one of the core ingredients of the modern soul. It first emerged, according to Weber’s account, among Calvinist Christians in northern Europe, who believed in the doctrine of predestination—that every human, since before they were born, had been preselected to be a member of the elect, and therefore entitled to spend eternity in heaven with God after death, or else as one of the damned, and thus guaranteed to spend it in hell. Early capitalism got much of its energy, Weber argued, from Calvinist merchants and tradesmen who felt that relentless hard work was one of the best ways to prove—to others, but also to themselves—that they belonged to the former category rather than the latter. Their commitment to frugal living supplied the other half of Weber’s theory of capitalism: when people spend their days generating vast amounts of wealth through hard work but also feel obliged not to fritter it away on luxuries, the inevitable result is large accumulations of capital.

The inventors of the Sabbath understood that it was a much more complicated undertaking. You cannot downshift casually and easily, the way you might slip into bed at the end of a long day. As the Cat in the Hat says, “It is fun to have fun but you have to know how.” This is why the Puritan and Jewish Sabbaths were so exactingly intentional, requiring extensive advance preparation—at the very least a scrubbed house, a full larder and a bath. The rules did not exist to torture the faithful. They were meant to communicate the insight that interrupting the ceaseless round of striving requires a surprisingly strenuous act of will, one that has to be bolstered by habit as well as social sanction.

And this realization isn’t merely calming but liberating, because once you’re no longer burdened by such an unrealistic definition of a “life well spent,” you’re freed to consider the possibility that a far wider variety of things might qualify as meaningful ways to use your finite time. You’re freed, too, to consider the possibility that many of the things you’re already doing with it are more meaningful than you’d supposed—and that until now, you’d subconsciously been devaluing them, on the grounds that they weren’t “significant” enough.

From this new perspective, it becomes possible to see that preparing nutritious meals for your children might matter as much as anything could ever matter, even if you won’t be winning any cooking awards; or that your novel’s worth writing if it moves or entertains a handful of your contemporaries, even though you know you’re no Tolstoy. Or that virtually any career might be a worthwhile way to spend a working life, if it makes things slightly better for those it serves. Furthermore, it means that if what we learn from the experience of the coronavirus pandemic is to become just a little more attuned to the needs of our neighbors, we’ll have learned something valuable as a result of the “Great Pause,” no matter how far off the root-and-branch transformation of society remains.

Writing in 1970, Marie-Louise von Franz, the Swiss psychologist and scholar of fairy tales, captured the otherworldly atmosphere of such an existence: There is a strange attitude and feeling that one is not yet in real life. For the time being one is doing this or that, but whether it is [a relationship with] a woman or a job, it is not yet what is really wanted, and there is always the fantasy that sometime in the future the real thing will come about … The one thing dreaded throughout by such a type of man is to be bound to anything whatever. There is a terrific fear of being pinned down, of entering space and time completely, and of being the unique human that one is.

Pursuing the life projects that matter to you the most will almost always entail not feeling fully in control of your time, immune to the painful assaults of reality, or confident about the future. It means embarking on ventures that might fail, perhaps because you’ll find you lacked sufficient talent; it means risking embarrassment, holding difficult conversations, disappointing others, and getting so deep into relationships that additional suffering—when bad things happen to those you care about—is all but guaranteed. And so we naturally tend to make decisions about our daily use of time that prioritize anxiety-avoidance instead. Procrastination, distraction, commitment-phobia, clearing the decks, and taking on too many projects at once are all ways of trying to maintain the illusion that you’re in charge of things.

This is the real reason why so many conflicts persist: Not because of a lack of solutions or because people are unwilling to compromise, but because combatants don’t understand why they are fighting in the first place. They haven’t discussed the deeper topics—the emotional issues—that are inflaming the dispute. And they’ve avoided that emotional discussion because they don’t want to admit they are furious and sad and worried. In other words, they don’t want to talk about How Do We Feel?, even though it’s the most important conversation to have.

So if a listener wants to prove they’re listening, they need to demonstrate it after the speaker finishes talking. If we want to show someone we’re paying attention, we need to prove, once that person has stopped speaking, that we have absorbed what they said. And the best way to do that is by repeating, in our own words, what we just heard them say—and then asking if we got it right.

French travelers marveled at how the Mississippi River had “a large number of tribes on both its banks,” but thought that the Natchez Confederacy “deserves to be distinguished from the rest, since this tribe is governed by a sovereign whom they obey with great respect and submission. He has a very comfortable dwelling, which, as far as the resources of the country permit, has various apartments. No one enters his presence until he has been informed of their coming.” The French were particularly enthralled to learn that this paramount leader, the Great Sun, “alone decides questions of peace or war, and all the important business which concerns the public.” This was a polity the French could understand and, perhaps, win over, potentially saving their unraveling empire.16

But regardless of frequency, nearly every marriage contained some degree of conflict.

The second discovery was that, for some couples, those conflicts and arguments didn’t seem to have much lasting impact. Regardless of how frequently some people battled, they said they were still fulfilled by their marriages, happy with their choice of spouse, and reported no thoughts of divorce or lingering rancor after a fight. Their conflicts were storms that appeared and then dissipated, leaving behind only blue skies.

Deep questions are particularly good at creating intimacy because they ask people to describe their beliefs, values, feelings, and experiences in ways that can reveal something vulnerable. And vulnerability sparks emotional contagion, which makes us more aligned. Deep questions can be as light as “What would be your perfect day?” or as heavy as “What do you regret most?” Deep questions don’t always seem deep at first: “Tell me about your family” or “Why do you look so happy today?” are easy to ask—and can be deep because they invite others to explain what makes them proud or worried, joyful or excited.

The last guide laid out some clues that are useful in determining what people want from a conversation. We can also learn to look for what they are feeling. But since it’s easy to mistake, say, frustration for anger, or quiet for sadness, it is critical to be attuned to two things: Mood: Do they seem upbeat or glum? How would you describe their expressions? Are they laughing, or shouting? Are they up or down? Energy: Are they high energy, or low energy? Quiet and withdrawn or talkative and expressive? If they seem happy, is it calm and content (low energy) or excited and outgoing (high energy)? If they are unhappy, are they sad (low energy) or agitated (high energy)?

Mood and energy levels often tell us all we need to know in order to align emotionally. Sometimes, we might not want to match emotions: If someone is angry, and we become angry, it may drive us apart. But if we acknowledge their mood and energy—“You seem upset. What’s wrong?”—we can start to align.

When we discuss the latest organizational gossip (“I hear everyone in accounting is going to get laid off”) or signal an affiliation (“We’re Knicks fans in this family”) or figure out social linkages (“You went to Berkeley?

You’ll never succeed at getting someone to change their behavior “if, as a prerequisite, you force them to say: Everything I’ve believed until now is wrong,” said Motta. But to Rosenbloom, it felt like the problem wasn’t just his patients. Doctors were influenced by social identities, as well. When Rosenbloom thought back to his mentors—such as the physician who told him to say I know better than you—he recognized this as arrogance caused by a social identity gone awry. That doctor thought he was superior because he belonged to a tribe of experts. No matter how much that physician had in common with his patients, no matter if they lived in the same neighborhood and sent their kids to the same school, once the patients had refused his advice, he saw them as part of an ignorant group, a tribe that deserved disdain. Rosenbloom hated to admit it, but sometimes he saw this same impulse in himself, as well. “You put on this white coat, and you start to think of yourself as the team with all the answers,” he told me. “And then, when a patient disagrees with you, you start thinking of them as backwards or wrong.”

Steele and his colleagues called this undermining effect stereotype threat, and since those first experiments in the late 1990s, hundreds of other studies have both confirmed its existence and examined its pernicious effect. Simply knowing that a stereotype exists can influence how we behave. For Black students, or women in advanced math courses, or many others, “it is the mere existence of the stereotype about their identity’s abilities in society that threatens them, not necessarily the racism of the people around them,” Steele said. Even if no one in the student’s orbit is prejudiced, the student can still be undermined by the knowledge that a stereotype exists, and that their performance “could be taken, because of the stereotype and its effect on people’s thinking, as confirmation of the stereotype.”

But the women in group three, who had been pushed to think about all the various facets of their lives and all the identities they possessed, ended up performing just as well as men. There was no difference in scores. The stereotype threat had been neutralized by reminding women of the multitudes of identities they possessed. “Drawing self-concept maps with few nodes proved ineffective,” the researchers wrote. “Drawing self-concept maps with many nodes, in contrast, allowed women who had been placed under stereotype threat to perform significantly better.”

In a Who Are We? conversation, we sometimes latch on to a single identity: I am your parent or I am the teacher or I am the boss. In doing so, though, we hobble ourselves, because we start to see the world solely through that one lens. We forget that we are all complex and that, if we were thinking like parents instead of doctors, we might also ask skeptical questions about the drugs a stranger wants to inject into our kids. We might remember that asking questions is what good parents are supposed to do.

The process for drawing out those voices is relatively straightforward: In a Who Are We? conversation, invite people to talk about their backgrounds, allegiances, how their communities have shaped them. (“Where are you from? Oh, really? What was it like growing up there?”) Then, reciprocate by describing how you see yourself. (“You know, as a southerner, I think that…”) Finally, avoid the trap of one-dimensionality by evoking all the many identities we all possess as a conversation unfolds: “I hear you saying that, as a lawyer, you support the police, but as a parent, do you worry about cops pulling over your kid?”

First, try to draw out your conversational partners’ multiple identities. It’s important to remind everyone that we all contain multitudes; none of us is one-dimensional. Acknowledging those complexities during a conversation helps disrupt the stereotypes within our heads. Second, try to ensure everyone is on equal footing. Don’t offer unsolicited advice or trumpet your wealth or connections. Seek out topics where everyone has some experience and knowledge, or everyone is a novice. Encourage the quiet to speak and the talkative to listen, so everyone is participating. Finally, look for social similarities that already exist. We do this naturally when we meet someone new and start searching for people we know in common. But it is important to take those connections a step further and make our commonalities more salient. Our similarities become powerful when they are rooted in something meaningful: We may both be friends with Jim, but that’s not much of a connection—until we start talking about what his friendship means to us, how Jim is an important part of both our lives. We may all be Lakers fans, but that only becomes powerful when we share what it felt like, for each of us, to go to games with our parents and watch Magic score, how we share the memory of that thrill.

The researchers—Michael Slepian and Drew Jacoby-Senghor—found there were lots of things that might make a conversation go bad. Someone might say something offensive, or they might say something ignorant, or cruel. They might alienate their companions intentionally, or it might occur by accident. But there was one behavior, in particular, that consistently made people uncomfortable and upset: If a speaker said something that lumped a listener into a group against her or his will, the discussion would likely go south. Sometimes speakers would assign listeners membership in a group they didn’t like—“You’re rich, so you know most rich people are snobs”—and the listener would be offended by the insinuation they were snobbish. Sometimes a speaker would deny someone membership in a group they esteemed—“You didn’t go to law school, so you don’t understand how the law actually works”—and the listener would be insulted by the accusation that they were uninformed. Sometimes, when speakers made such comments, they were indirect: “You’re one of the good Republicans, but most of them only care about themselves” or “You got into that college because you’re smart, but some people like you get in because of affirmative action.” Occasionally the person making the comment seemed to have no idea they were offending: “Since you don’t have kids, you might not understand how a parent feels seeing a child treated that way.” Regardless of the phrasing, the result was consistent: Anger and alienation, a conversation that fell apart.

Another researcher put it more bluntly: “The most important influence, by far, on a flourishing life is love.” Not romantic love, but, rather, the kinds of deep connections we form with our families, friends, and coworkers, as well as neighbors and people from our community. “Love early in life facilitates not only love later on, but also the other trappings of success, such as prestige and even high income. It also encourages the development of coping styles that facilitate intimacy, as opposed to ones that discourage it.”

Marsden didn’t mention other people, or relationships, except in a negative sense. When he felt depressed, rather than seek out companions, he went to his office and tried to use his legal practice to distract himself. When he argued with his wife or children, he stomped off and withdrew, rather than talking through issues until a resolution, or at least an understanding, emerged. “He was a very self-critical person,” said Waldinger, who currently leads the Harvard project. “He pushed himself hard and judged himself pretty harshly, and that made him successful in his profession. But it also meant he was critical of other people, which is probably what alienated so many of them.” As one summary of Marsden’s surveys put it, “he developed a wariness of people and habitually negative ways of coping with the world. He had difficulty connecting with others, and when he encountered challenges, his instinct was to withdraw from the people closest to him. He married twice, and never felt that he was truly loved.”

He met some for Bible study, and with others to play cards, and formed relationships with nurses and orderlies. He later told researchers that his time in the hospital had felt like a rebirth. “Someone with a capital ‘S’ cared about me,” he wrote on one survey. “Nothing has been so tough since that year.” When he left the hospital, he joined a church and threw himself into committees, potlucks, Sunday school—anything where he could meet other people. Researchers later determined that, until the age of thirty, Camille didn’t have one real, durable friendship; a decade later, he was among the most socially active people in the study, and as his network expanded, his career took off. “My professional life hasn’t been disappointing—far from it—but the truly gratifying unfolding has been into the person I’ve slowly become,” he wrote on a survey at the age of seventy-five. “Connectedness is something we must let happen to us…. What durable and pliable creatures we are, and what a storehouse of goodwill lurks in the social fabric.” Talking to other people, connecting with them, sharing his joys and sorrows, he said, had transformed his life. “You know what I learned?” he told one interviewer. “I learned love.”

THE DUAL THREAT of Indigenous power and English expansion from the east terrified the French inhabitants in Louisiana to their core. The Natchez war had shown, with graphic immediacy, what disregard for Indigenous sovereignty, traditions, and needs could bring: cataclysmic violence, massive loss of life and property, the utter collapse of colonial institutions. The violence discouraged French investments in the colony and impeded France’s empire-building in the lower Mississippi Valley. It also taught the colonists how little they could do without Native approval. In Louisiana, Indigenous customs prevailed, turning a colonial space into a hybrid one.

Davenport ultimately became frustrated with the difficulty of making meaningful progress on this topic and moved on to more rewarding areas. “In most cases, people don’t measure the productivity of knowledge workers,” he explained. “And when we do, we do it in really silly ways, like how many papers do academics produce, regardless of quality. We are still in the quite early stages.”

Knowledge work organizations took this recommendation seriously. The carefully engineered systems of factories were replaced with the “personal productivity” of offices, in which individuals deploy their own ad hoc and often ill-defined collection of tools and hacks to make sense of their jobs, with no one really knowing how anyone else is managing their work. In such a haphazard setting, there’s no system to easily improve, no knowledge equivalent of the ten times productivity boost attributed to the assembly line. Drucker himself eventually grew to recognize the difficulties of pursuing productivity amid so much autonomy. “I think he did believe it was hard to improve . . . we let the inmates run the asylum, let them do the work as they wish,” Tom Davenport told me, recalling conversations he had with Drucker in the 1990s.

It was from this uncertainty that a simple alternative emerged: using visible activity as a crude proxy for actual productivity. If you can see me in my office—or, if I’m remote, see my email replies and chat messages arriving regularly—then, at the very least, you know I’m doing something. The more activity you see, the more you can assume that I’m contributing to the organization’s bottom line. Similarly, the busier I am as a freelancer or entrepreneur, the more I can be assured I’m doing all I can to get after it. As the twentieth century progressed, this visible-activity heuristic became the dominant way we began thinking about productivity in knowledge work.

Across Italy, other local Slow Food chapters began to emerge. The group promoted slow meals, eaten communally, made from local and seasonal ingredients. After a while, they took on related goals, such as the introduction of regional food curricula into local grammar schools, and efforts to preserve traditional foods, like the delicious Vesuvian apricot, native to the Campania region in southern Italy. In 1996, the movement organized the first Salone del Gusto in Turin to support local food traditions and artisans. Held biannually, the event now attracts over 200,000 visitors who can sample from over 1,500 stalls. Today, there are Slow Food chapters in 160 countries.

The first such idea is the power of appealing alternatives. As Michael Pollan summarizes in an insightful 2003 article about Slow Food, by the 1980s Carlo Petrini had become “dismayed by the hangdog dourness of his comrades on the left.” There’s a personal satisfaction in grimly pointing out the flaws in a system, but sustainable change, Petrini came to believe, requires providing people with an enjoyable and life-affirming alternative. Petrini didn’t simply write a sharply worded op-ed about the corruptive forces of McDonald’s, he instead promoted an appealing new relationship with food that would make fast food seem self-evidently vulgar. “Those who suffer for others do more damage to humanity than those who enjoy themselves,” Petrini explained.

As the journalist Carl Honoré documents in his 2004 book, In Praise of Slowness, these second-wave movements include Slow Cities, which also started in Italy (where it’s called Cittaslow), and focuses on making cities more pedestrian-centric, supportive of local business, and, in a general sense, more neighborly. They also include Slow Medicine, which promotes the holistic care of people as opposed to focusing only on disease, and Slow Schooling, which attempts to free elementary school students from the pressures of high-stakes testing and competitive tracking. More recently, the Slow Media movement has emerged to promote more sustainable and higher-quality alternatives to digital clickbait, and the term Slow Cinema is increasingly used to describe realistic, largely nonnarrative movies that reward extended attention with deeper insight into the human condition. “The slow movement was first seen as an idea for a few people who liked to eat and drink well,” explained the mayor of Petrini’s hometown of Bra. “But now it has become a much broader cultural discussion about the benefits of doing things in a more human, less frenetic manner.”

With this goal in mind, in the pages that follow, I present a collection of more practical strategies designed to help you gain mastery over the small obligations in your professional life. This topic of taming tasks is one I’ve tackled before. In my book Deep Work, for example, I included a chapter titled “Drain the Shallows,” which explored this theme. In it, I recommended better organizing your hours using time blocking—a strategy, as it turns out, that was originally pioneered by Franklin—so that tasks could be better separated from deeper efforts. I also suggested writing more structured emails to minimize unnecessary back-and-forth messaging, an objective I elaborate in much greater detail in a follow-up book I published a half decade later titled A World Without Email. Surrounding these books are numerous pages of articles and hours of podcast discussions where I’ve also tackled this topic in depth.

Containing tasks is not about escaping the small. It’s instead about making these efforts as painless as possible. Seeking, as I once put it, that “low-stress sweet spot.”

From a slow productivity perspective, however, there’s good news embedded in this otherwise discouraging account. If much of your perceived busyness comes from talking about tasks instead of actually executing them, you might be less overloaded than you realize. In other words, if you can reduce the footprint of these conversations, the pile of actual, concrete obligations that remains might not be so forbidding. A direct strategy for reducing collaboration overhead is to replace asynchronous communication with real-time conversations.

During these sessions, your team churns through any pending tasks that require collaboration or clarification. The group moves through the tasks one at a time, figuring out for each what exactly needs to be done, who is working on it, and what information they need from others. An easy way to organize these sessions is to maintain a shared document of tasks to discuss. Team members can add items to the list as they come up in between meetings. One thirty-minute docket-clearing session can save a team from hours of highly distracting inbox checking and back-and-forth emailing.

In the short term, all of this costs money. If your company is new, or your income still modest, it can be unnerving to see a nontrivial percent of these earnings go right back out the door. But in the long term, this off-loading of the small can provide the mental space needed to make the types of large breakthroughs, and produce the type of value, that will make these monthly expenses suddenly seem trivial in scope. Don’t spend more than you can afford. But recognize that a practitioner of slow productivity cannot afford to spend nothing.

This reality should motivate those in this position to energetically embrace the strategies discussed in this chapter. To avoid projects that generate excessive tasks, or to spend more money to outsource busywork, is not some sort of shady hack you hope your employer or clients don’t notice.

Shifting to a pull-based operation made backlogs impossible: the pace of the pipeline would adapt to whatever stage was running slowest. This transparency, in turn, helped the workers identify places where the system was out of balance. “A perpetually full pull box means either the downstream task is moving too slowly or the upstream one is moving too quickly,” write the authors. “An empty pull box at the end of the day means that something is wrong with the operation that feeds it.” The improvements yielded by this approach were quantifiable.

SIMULATED PULL, PART 1: HOLDING TANK AND ACTIVE LISTS The first step in simulating a pull-based workflow is tracking all projects to which you’re currently committed on a list divided into two sections: “holding tank” and “active.” (The format used for storing this list doesn’t really matter. You can use a text file on your computer, for example, or an old-fashioned notebook: whatever you find easiest.) Recall, when I say “projects,” I mean something substantial enough to require multiple sessions to complete.

When a new project is pushed toward you, place it in the holding-pen section of your list. There is no bound to the size of your holding tank. The active position of the list, by contrast, should be limited to three projects at most. When scheduling your time, you should focus your attention only on the projects on your active list.

SIMULATED PULL, PART 2: INTAKE PROCEDURE When adding a new project to your holding tank, it’s important to update the source of this new obligation about what they should expect. To do so, send an acknowledgment message that formally acknowledges the project that you’re committing to complete, but that also includes the following three pieces of extra information: (1) a request for any additional details you need from the source before you can start the project, (2) a count of the number of existing projects already on your lists, and (3) an estimate of when you expect to complete this new work. After sending this message, label the project with the time estimate you included in your acknowledgment message so you won’t later forget. Notice, when making this estimate, you can look at the estimates on all of your existing projects to help inform a realistic prediction.

SIMULATED PULL, PART 3: LIST CLEANING You should update and clean your lists once a week. In addition to pulling in new work to fill empty slots on your active list, you should also review upcoming deadlines. Prioritize what’s due soon, and send updates for any work that you know you’re not going to finish by the time promised. These cleaning sessions also provide a good opportunity to remove from your holding tank projects that are languishing. If you’ve delayed the same project again and again, for example, this might be a good sign that you’re not really equipped to handle it, or that it falls outside your comfort zone.

When it comes to taming appointments, a good target is to ensure that no more than half of the hours in any single day are dedicated to meetings or calls. The simplest way to meet this mark is to declare certain hours to be protected (e.g., no meetings before noon). In some office contexts, of course, it might be hard to get away with strict rules of this type. (“What do you mean you don’t take meetings before noon? That’s when I’m available!”) A subtler alternative is to instead implement a “one for you, one for me” strategy. Every time you add a meeting to your calendar for a given day, find an equal amount of time that day to protect. If I schedule thirty minutes for a call on Tuesday, I’ll also find another thirty minutes that day to block off on my calendar as protected for myself. As a given day starts to fill up with appointments, it also fills up with protected blocks, making it increasingly harder to add something new.

Schedule Rest Projects It can be stressful to start blocking out large chunks of time on your calendar for a major new project. Each new appointment you add represents less flexibility and more intense work in your near-future schedule. As your calendar continues to fill during busy periods, a sense of mild despair can arise. How will I ever get this all done? A clever way to balance this stress is to pair each major work project with a corresponding rest project. The idea is simple: after putting aside time on your calendar for a major work project, schedule in the days or weeks immediately following it time to pursue something leisurely and unrelated to your work.

The general idea that quality tools can increase the quality of your work is not unique to my early academic career. Novelists find a burst of energy when they switch from a generic word processor to professional writing software like Scrivener, just as screenwriters feel more capable when they buy Final Draft to compose their movies. It’s true that these more expensive tools include more features than their cheaper counterparts, but the “I’m a professional now” vibe they induce is arguably just as valuable. We see a similar effect in podcasters who buy the $300 Shure microphone famously used by Joe Rogan. In most cases, their audience wouldn’t care about the minor quality difference between that professional mic and a cheaper USB option, but to the aspiring podcaster, it’s a signal to themselves that they’re taking the pursuit seriously. We also see these dynamics at play when computer programmers set up elaborate digital workstations featuring two or three monitors. These programmers will swear that the ability to see multiple windows at once increases productivity. This is true to an extent, but earlier generations of computer programmers seemed to be plenty productive before the recent introduction of graphic drivers capable of supporting multiple displays. Part of the power of these setups is found in their complexity, which puts the user in a specialized mindset, ready to do the hard work of writing efficient programs. The pursuit of quality is not a casual endeavor.

As McPhee’s career advanced, he evolved, through trial and error, a more involved and repeatable process for producing his distinctive style of long-form journalism. As he explained in Draft No. 4, he would begin by copying all of his observations from his notebooks, and transcribing all of his tape-recorded interviews, onto fresh pages, pounded out on an Underwood 5 manual typewriter. “The note-typing could take many weeks,” he explains, “but it collected everything in one legible place, and it ran all the raw material in some concentration through the mind.”

Prague’s window ledges struck me as a kind of metaphor for what is happening in our law. Often enough, men and women going about their lives with no intention of harming anyone are getting thwacked, unexpectedly and at times haphazardly, by our multitude of statutes, rules, regulations, orders, edicts, and decrees. Almost always, one authority or another replies that, while the impact on the individual at hand is most regrettable, we should really focus on the greater good our laws and regulations seek to achieve and the collective social progress they promise.

Those armed with influential lobbyists may even find ways to make a profusion of laws work to their advantage. But what about everyday Americans and the rights promised to them in our Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights? What happens to those people and their foundational freedoms—like the right to speak, pray, and gather freely—when our laws increasingly restrict what we may say, monitor what we do, and tell us how we may live? What does it mean for our nation’s promise of equal treatment when our laws become so numerous and so complex that only an affluent or connected few can navigate their way? And what happens to our respect for law itself when the law no longer just reflects commonsense norms but includes unpredictable traps for the unwary?

Really, the questions at the heart of this book are ancient ones. At the dawn of our republic, James Madison contemplated the dangers to individual freedom, equal treatment of persons, and respect for law itself when a nation’s laws are allowed to grow “so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood . . . or undergo such incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is today, can guess what it will be tomorrow.”13 But if the questions Madison posed are old ones, they also seem to me ones with special relevance to our times.

No one group, party, or impulse is to blame for the recent changes in our nation’s approach to law. These days, we are a people who trust one another less and less. When a problem arises, we are no longer so inclined to rely on individual judgment, our neighbors, or our local institutions to address it. When an idea becomes popular, it seems our first impulse is to embody it in law and debut the new rule on a national stage. In our eagerness for quick solutions, we sometimes look to agency officials rather than our elected representatives. Sometimes, too, we do so with a demand for strict conformity and little effort to accommodate different views. All of these impulses have become deeply entrenched in our society. And they are developments thoughtful people of any stripe can appreciate hold serious consequences for the integrity of our law and the lives and liberties of every American.

Pennsylvania’s infamous “Walking Purchase” marked a turning point in the history of the Indigenous continent. In the mid-eighteenth century, English colonists began to dispossess Indians more methodically. Indigenous borders, sovereignty, and lives were under unprecedented attack in the East. Buoyed by a booming economy and an influx of German, Swiss, Scottish, and Irish immigrants, southeastern Pennsylvania had seventy-three thousand European inhabitants in 1740. Philadelphia alone had become a city of ten thousand. Land—its ownership, use, division, and loss—was now a burning issue. Such established institutions as the “At the Woods’ Edge Ceremony” became marginalized, and shared borderlands became contested grounds.2

THE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR involved Indians from the very beginning. Native Americans observed the lead-up to the war, gauging how best to navigate it and perhaps benefit from it. The Shawnees started attacking the Iroquois in 1753, reaffirming their sovereignty to both the Six Nations and the Europeans. The attacks triggered further realignments, creating a chain reaction that saw Native nations reassessing their options. The Six Nations made peace with the Catawbas, hoping to end a century-long raiding war and restore stability. The Lenapes joined the French, and the Shawnees declared a “perpetual war” against Britain. French officials were elated, but the Shawnees would not be submissive allies. They would fight the British for their own reasons and in their own way, routinely rejecting French demands and pleas. Their principal ambition was to disentangle themselves from the Six Nations, which they considered a far more dangerous adversary than the British and French Empires.

The Indians responded in kind. In the Ohio Country, Neolin, a Lenape prophet, announced that he had journeyed to heaven, spoken to the creator, and received instructions on how to drive the White people off of Indian lands. Back on Earth, Neolin began to preach about separate creations of humanity. The Master of Life had created different kinds of people—Indians, Blacks, and Whites—for different parts of the world, but the Europeans had shattered that divine design by colonizing America. Neolin’s was a message with hard racial categories. Although he drew from Christian teachings and ideas, he wanted Native Americans to denounce the European god, European goods, and European ideas about land. He wanted them to embrace a purer way of life. He even wanted Native soldiers to abandon European technology and turn back to traditional Native weaponry to ensure self-sufficiency when the war came. Neolin’s plan was patient: all his soldiers were to go through seven years of training. Preaching near Fort Detroit, Neolin prophesized a new world without British settlers, diseases, and alcohol, the last of which was ruining and killing uncounted numbers of Indians.

The 1783 Treaty of Paris extinguished that long-standing ambition. The thirteen colonies were severed from the British Empire and recognized as the United States of America. Native Americans had not been invited to the treaty talks, and they knew to expect an undesirable outcome. Still, when the news arrived, they were shocked and appalled. The treaty gave the United States an enormous territory between the Appalachians and the Mississippi River, including the southern Great Lakes. The United States was an instant empire, claiming lands far beyond its effective borders. The change was so abrupt that it took Jefferson, ordinarily an expeditious labeler, several years to define the new empire. He called it an “empire of liberty.” For most Native Americans, it was a crude robber regime.28 Contemporary Europeans saw the 1783 treaty as a decisive turning point in the North American continent’s history that spelled doom for Native Americans, who could no longer play rival colonial powers against one another.

By contrast, a shared political philosophy founded on spiritual and prophetic nativism tightened the bonds of the Indian Confederacy's member nations, while nascent racial thinking defined Native Americans as separate from Anglo-Americans. Increasing numbers of Indians began to think of themselves as people of color, separate from Whites.

Even when militarily diminished, the Six Nations’ moral authority remained palpable. They demanded compensation for lost lands and pressured U.S. agents to respect their traditions. They instructed their assigned commissioner, Timothy Pickering, an austere Yankee, in their diplomatic protocols, ceremonies, and ideas of justice. A particularly charged issue was how to respond to murders. U.S. officials demanded public trials and executions, whereas the Iroquois preferred covering graves of the victims with gifts that eased pain and restored order. Eventually, Pickering concluded that the frontier colonists were “far more savage & revengeful than the Indians themselves,” prompting President Washington to note that “it is in the highest degree mortifying to find that the bulk of the frontier inhabitants consider the killing of Indians in time of peace, to be no crime and that their murderers are faultless, provided they escape detection.”24

Knox, a staunch paternalist, had little use for the rough American colonists, but he had developed sympathy for the Native Americans. Unlike most U.S. officials, he did not see or treat the Indians as conquered peoples. But Knox’s was a minority view. The U.S. government was already planning a string of forts in the Ohio Country. “As long as Britain is suffered to retain these posts, we can never hope to succeed against the Indians,” the representatives of the U.S. Congress despaired.27

In short, Tocqueville concluded, “everywhere that, at the head of a new undertaking, you see the government in France and a great lord in England, count on it that you will perceive an association in the United States.”66 These days, many of those old civic bonds are fraying. In his book Bowling Alone, Robert Putnam reports that “both civic engagement and organizational involvement experienced marked declines during the second half of the twentieth century.” In recent years, those declines have “continued uninterrupted.”67 A few decades ago, over 70 percent of Americans were members of a church, synagogue, or mosque; today fewer than half are.68 The Elks, a fraternal order that boasts six presidents among its past members, has “struggled” in recent years “with [a] massive decline in membership.”69 The Freemasons have shed three million from their ranks since the 1950s—a 75 percent decline.70

In euphoric celebrations in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere, few paused to consider that almost all of the extraordinary land purchase was under Indigenous rule. Nor did the Americans acknowledge the fact that France had claimed the transferred territory only up to the Missouri-Mississippi confluence, which made the transaction all but invalid. Jefferson floated the idea of turning the Louisiana Purchase into a gargantuan Indian colony. The purchase was compromised in another way as well. What the United States had purchased from France was the power of preemption through the Doctrine of Discovery, which gave it the exclusive right to obtain Indigenous titles either by conquest or by contract. Too weak to reduce the Indians to subjects, the United States had to negotiate contracts with sovereign Native nations. They would have to do so 222 times between 1804 and 1970, the largest cessions occurring before 1867.7

Wilkinson and Pike’s unauthorized maneuvering revealed how fractured and weak the young nation was beyond the original states in the East. Americans saw Indians as uncivilized nonstate peoples, but in reality, Native Americans were often far better organized than their adversaries. The Lakotas and Dakotas, along with most Indigenous nations, had sophisticated decision-making systems that revolved around regular nationwide councils and direct participation by the nation’s people: most Native nations made decisions based on consensus and frequently included both women and men in the deliberations. As a result, Native Americans were able to present a unified front to outsiders and enemies.

In 1725, an unusual vessel anchored on the Northwest Coast: Peter the Great, the Russian emperor, had sent the Danish navigator Vitus Bering to explore the region for potential colonizing ventures. Sailing south from the Kamchatka Peninsula, Bering had confirmed that there was a strait between Asia and North America, enabling Russian ships to sail south along the Northwest Coast. Although the strait was a major discovery, the Russians did not capitalize on it until the 1740s, when their fur traders entered California. Bering’s discovery had engendered an enormously lucrative trade in sea otter pelts with the Indians on the Gulf of Alaska; a “New Russia” seemed a real possibility. Spanish, British, and Americans also entered the pelt business, and soon trade boomed all along the Northwest Coast, but the Russian traders treated the Indians harshly, forcing them to hunt sea otter pelts by keeping their wives hostage.16

For Madison, down any other path lay “calamitous” risks. In governments where lawmaking is easy, he wrote, laws can quickly become “so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood,” and they may “undergo such incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is today, can guess what it will be tomorrow.” The “sagacious, the enterprising, and the moneyed few” may be able to anticipate, influence, and even profit from so much shifting law. But the “industrious . . . mass of the people” can do none of those things. In the end, law serves as an instrument only “for the few, not for the many,” sapping and ultimately destroying confidence in public institutions and law itself.79

As Madison appreciated, the rule of law does not mean rule by law. Adolf Hitler blanketed Germany with laws—many secret and unknowable except to those in the Führer’s favor.80 The rule of law demands more than that. It requires laws that are publicly declared, knowable to ordinary people, and stable. So, for example, new legislation generally cannot be applied retroactively to past conduct you cannot alter but only to future behavior you can control. The rule of law is usually understood, as well, to guarantee that disputes about what a particular law means will be decided by independent and neutral judges, so that even the unpopular and most vulnerable among us receive a fair hearing.81 These are just a few examples. In an effort to capture the spirit of the rule of law, the Oxford University philosopher Joseph Raz once called it a set of principles designed to “constrain the way government actions change and apply the law—to make sure, among other things, that they maintain stability and predictability, and thus enable individuals to find their way and to live well.”82

Not only has the federal government in relatively recent times assumed vast new responsibilities over matters once left to the states, it also has taken the reins in less direct ways. Unlike state and local governments, which operate with limited funds, the federal government enjoys the power to print money. And federal authorities have increasingly employed this power as a lever over state policy. Between 1960 and 2019, federal grants to states rose from $70 billion (adjusted for inflation) to over $700 billion—a 900 percent increase.52 Regularly, these grants come with strings attached that require states to enforce all manner of federal rules and standards.

They had entered into treaties with the United States, securing guarantees for their sovereignty, and they had built roads, stores, taverns, churches, fenced fields, cotton plantations, mills, and schools. Sequoyah, a brilliant Cherokee scholar, had invented a Cherokee alphabet. Much of this was part of a calculated strategy: the Cherokees had adhered to the American standard of civilization to convince the U.S. government to let them stay in their ancestral homelands. They published newspapers and had a ninety percent literacy rate, and they were well-off, having improved the land through intensive farming. The Cherokees, along with the Chickasaws, Choctaws, and Muscogees, relied on Black slave labor, often outperforming their White neighbors in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, even though their slave regimes were far less brutal. Choctaw women were able to bring more than ten thousand yards of cloth each year to the market. Such achievements spelled trouble: few things infuriated American settlers more than seeing Indians outdo them. Indian-hating became virulent across the South.10

The Indians resisted the removal schemes fiercely, and they had a compelling case: Congress was concerned that the supply of public land far exceeded the demand. Even in land-hungry Georgia, settlers admitted that they had too much land to farm. It was clear that the underlying motives driving Indigenous dispossession were not economic but racial. In 1821, the governor of Georgia announced that it was his ambition to replace “all the red for a white population.” Three years later, Secretary of War Calhoun, without informing Congress, created the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a new division within the War Department, providing the nation with its own colonial office.

Despite the Lakotas’ increasing reach, theirs was not a territorial empire in the European style. It was, instead, an empire that sought to amass people, resources, and spiritual power. Lakota armies ventured out from their core area around Pahá Sápa, capturing horses and humans and keeping enemies out of their hunting ranges. They now dominated the fur trade along the upper Missouri and South Platte Valleys, and closer by, their mobile war parties kept the weakened Pawnee, Otoe, Ponca, Omaha, Arikara, Mandan, and Hidatsa farmers under siege, stealing corn, horses, and people. In their own villages, Lakota women processed tens of thousands of buffalo robes a year for U.S. markets, securing munitions, clothing, and luxuries for their people, thus safeguarding the military might and prestige of their nation. All seven Lakota oyátes followed the same policy, keeping people and power movable and channeling both wherever they were needed. Their maneuvers made the Lakotas appear far more formidable than they actually were, enabling them to control an oversized segment of the continent.

The Lakota ascendancy rested on a horse-powered capacity to connect and exploit key nodes: river valleys, prime bison grounds, corn-yielding Native villages, American trading posts, and Pahá Sápa. Theirs was a kinetic empire whose power stemmed from the systematic repetition of key political acts: short- and long-range raids, tribute extraction, and diplomatic missions, which gave the empire an on-again, off-again character: it could be all over the place one moment and hidden the next. The Americans never realized its existence.

AS THE LAKOTAS WERE transforming themselves into an empire, Missouri senator Thomas Hart Benton announced, in 1846, that the only empire on the continent belonged to the Americans: “The white race alone received the divine command, to subdue and replenish the earth! For it is the only race that has obeyed it [and] the only one that hunts out new and distant lands, and even a new World, to subdue and replenish. . . . The red race has disappeared from the Atlantic coast: the tribes that resisted civilization meet extinction. This is a cause of lamentation with many. For my part, I cannot murmur at what seems to be the effect of divine law.” Many Americans shared Benton’s views of Indigenous peoples as a doomed race, but the Lakotas would soon set them straight, making it clear that there was nothing preordained about the United States’ cynical expansionism.30

The U.S. agents had designated the Platte River as the southern border of the Lakota domain, but the Lakotas demanded the central plains all the way south to the Arkansas River by the right of conquest. “These lands once belonged to the Kiowas and the Crows,” Black Hawk explained, “but we whipped these nations out of them, and in this we did what the white men do when they want the lands of the Indians.” The Lakotas made it clear that they expected a two-hundred-mile southward extension of their domain. In the northern Great Plains, colonial borders would bend around Lakota borders; Americans would have to remove the Pawnees to the south to make space for the Lakotas. The United States had sided with power. Desperate to protect the Santa Fe Trail, American agents tried to convince the Comanches, Kiowas, and Plains Apaches to settle in a domain south of the Arkansas River. The Indians took the gifts, agreed to a treaty, and went on attacking the intruding wagon trains.

Whereas the Comanches built a more centralized nation and, eventually, an empire, the Apaches preserved the fluid and seasonally dynamic political system that had served them well before the Comanche ascendancy. The authority of the Apache leaders, nantans, did not typically reach beyond immediate kin groups. That horizontal governing system had served the Apaches well, enabling them to expand their resource base three hundred miles to the west of the Pecos Valley without major internal conflicts, but the rise of the Comanches rendered everything precarious. By the early nineteenth century, the combined Apache population in the southern plains was only about five thousand. Spanish officials branded the Apaches as heathens and “indomitable savages” who should be exterminated.15

Colonel George Custer, burning with ambition, attacked Black Kettle’s village on the Washita River, killing dozens of soldiers and women and children. U.S. Indian policy was misguided, vicious, and incompetent all at once, entangling the nation in unnecessary wars that only weakened its authority in the critical midsection of the continent. All in all, it was a massive miscalculation that would quickly come to haunt the U.S. Army. The central plains became dangerous to Americans, and soon a U.S. official complained that the Kiowas and Comanches “have been doing much of this wrong.

Since the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, the Comanches had gone into a steep decline owing to a catastrophic drought in the southern plains: grasses withered, and their empire vanished into hot air. Taking advantage of the Comanches’ plight, U.S. agents made an offer: cede 140,000 square miles, accept a fifty-five-hundred-square-mile reservation in the Indian Territory, and allow military forts to be built in Comanchería in return for annuity payments. It was an insult and a betrayal. The Comanches rejected the land cession but signed the Treaty of Medicine Lodge in 1867, which recognized their traditional hunting privileges in the southern plains. To the Comanches, hunting privileges were ownership. Although diminished, they were still a force that Americans could not ignore. U.S. officials expected the Comanches to grow crops and live in peace; the Comanches made their Mexican captives do most of the tilling. They also raided Navajos, Choctaws, Cherokees, and Lenapes in the Indian Territory. Like the Iroquois before them, even in decline the Comanches could terrify outsiders and impose their will.20

Now, however, U.S. expansionism was facilitated by a menacing chain reaction: when one Native nation was subjugated, another one became exposed, making it possible for the Americans to channel their forces against one nation at a time. Native peoples were forced to rely on the weapons of the weak: mobility, evasion, invisibility, and quiet defiance.

The Mormon leader Brigham Young, serving as the superintendent of Indian affairs for the Utah Territory, complained that the Shoshones “are so broken up into small bands, that it is impossible to tell with any degree of accuracy their numbers.” He wanted them to “not depend on hunting for living, but to settle on good localities where they could raise grain.” Young tried to render the Shoshones visible, manageable, and productive. The Shoshones flatly ignored him. Being inconspicuous kept them safe. But when Mormon settlers pushed into their territory, the Shoshones retaliated by killing and wounded dozens of them. In 1863, Union forces intervened, murdering several hundred Shoshones in what became known as the Bear River Massacre. The Mormons looked for other ways to extract wealth from local Indians. Considering bondage natural, and branding both Africans and Indians as “dark and loathsome,” they began to buy large numbers of Indian children.32

IN THE LONG AFTERMATH OF THE BATTLE OF THE LITTLE Bighorn, the Indian Office criminalized the Sun Dance in 1882, creating a gaping spiritual void in numerous Native nations. In the winter of 1889, the Lakotas heard of a new religion, the Ghost Dance, preached by Wovoka, a Northern Paiute holy man. Lakota envoys rode trains to Nevada to learn firsthand from the prophet. A blend of millenarian and modern elements, the Ghost Dance seemed to offer Indians the tools to survive in a rapidly changing world, and it began to fill the emptiness left by the U.S. government’s ban on the Sun Dance.

The Ojibwe writer David Treuer argues that when it comes to views of the continent’s wilderness, “America has succeeded in becoming more Indian over the past 245 years rather than the other way around.” It is a comment on the enduring and often unseen impact of Indigenous culture. But beyond Treuer’s specific claim, it is worth pausing to consider just how recent the United States, and its ascendancy, are. The four hundred years of colonialism that followed Columbus’s arrival failed to extinguish Indigenous sovereignty in North America. It was only 130 years ago, a brief span when compared to the long precontact history of Indigenous America, that the United States could claim to have subjugated a critical mass of Native Americans. Iroquois power lasted from the sixteenth century deep into the nineteenth century, making the Iroquois Nation older and more historically central than the United States. On an Indigenous timescale, the United States is a mere speck.

Truly, Kalamazoo served as a laboratory of democracy. Our history is replete with similar examples. Many towns, counties, and states granted women the right to vote long before the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment.74 The territory of Wyoming, the first to allow women the right to vote, went so far as to refuse to enter the Union without women’s suffrage. “We will remain out of the Union one hundred years rather than come in without the women,” its legislature fired off to Congress when asked to rescind women’s voting rights as a condition of statehood.75 Minimum-wage laws and child labor laws were also adopted at the local level before being embraced nationally.76 New York State helped start the movement in this country to end debtors’ prisons.

California State Supreme Court Justice Goodwin Liu reminds us of a particularly poignant example. For decades before and after the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, federal courts routinely upheld deeply unjust segregation laws as consistent with the federal Constitution. “What is lesser known,” Justice Liu reminds us, is that “despite Plessy . . . , between the period from about the mid-1800s to 1900, there were several dozen state court decisions about school segregation. More than half of those cases granted relief to the black plaintiffs, largely on state constitutional or statutory grounds, within the confines of Plessy.” In fact, as Justice Liu continues, the road to Brown v. Board of Education was paved with state court decisions. So much that, “in 1955, when the U.S. Supreme Court rendered its disposition in the Brown cases, it reversed . . . three federal district courts and affirmed . . . one state high court. I think that alone should give us pause in thinking about who are the heroes and who are the villains.”81

Federalism’s often overlooked virtues don’t just include permitting policy responses tailored to local conditions (Butte’s lesson), creating room for experimentation from which we all might learn (Kalamazoo), and serving as a check against hasty missteps at the federal level (the tragedy of Buck and the path to Brown). The framers designed our Constitution with ordinary individuals, their liberties, their right to self-governance, and their need to feel connected to their institutions in mind—and federalism was a key part of that plan as well. Federalism allows more people more ways to exercise their democratic muscles, feel ownership in our republican institutions, and grow attached to them. And it is through this active participation in our government that we learn and pass along from generation to generation the habits required to sustain our democratic experiment.

While he was an early advocate for administrative power, Justice William O.

They should be more closely confined to specific ends or goals.”67 But that wish, too, seems now a world away. If laws governing major facets of our society were once largely the work of elected representatives and the product of democratic compromises, nowadays they often represent only the current thinking of relatively insulated agency officials in a distant city. It’s a result that, as Justice William J.

For those who believed in the ideal of administrative agencies free from presidential oversight, Justice Sutherland’s opinion was “a thrilling triumph.” It “echoed down the corridors of the independent tribunals and administrative bodies of the government . . . throw[ing] a mantle of protection over a large group of public officers who are called upon to exercise independent judgment.”99 The victory was laced with irony, too. Justice Sutherland was not exactly known for his embrace of progressive philosophy. For his perceived hostility to the New Deal, some had derisively labeled him one of the “horsemen of the apocalypse.”100 But in the course of handing this particular defeat to President Roosevelt, Justice Sutherland endorsed a decidedly expansive view of agency authority. While the decision had its fans in some quarters, others had a hard time wrapping their heads around it. If the FTC wasn’t within the executive branch, in which of the Constitution’s three branches did it reside? How can an agency exercise “quasi-legislative” and “quasi-judicial” powers without having to follow the Constitution’s provisions governing the exercise of the legislative and judicial powers? And how can any agency do all that free of presidential oversight and thus electoral accountability to the American people? Robert H. Jackson, later appointed to the Supreme Court by President Roosevelt, reported that, though the case was “damn little” at one level, it “made Roosevelt madder at the Court than any other decision.”101

Over time, however, courts retreated from those traditional rules in favor of new ones that benefitted the government. Almost forty years after the APA’s adoption, for example, the Supreme Court decided a case called Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council.139 In its aftermath, some read the Court’s decision as requiring judges to begin deferring to an agency’s “reasonable” resolution of any legal ambiguity.140 So rather than resolving doubts about the law’s meaning in favor of individuals, rather than construing any ambiguities against those who write the rules, and rather than providing their own independent judgment of the law’s meaning, courts started allowing federal agencies to judge the meaning of the very laws that govern them. That’s what happened in the Hemingway museum case: the court there rejected the museum’s challenge to the agency’s rules by explaining that it considered itself obliged to defer to the agency’s interpretation of Congress’s governing statute.141

None of this is to say that Wilson didn’t have a point. Ours is an increasingly complex world. But if Wilson diagnosed a problem, it’s fair to ask questions about the wisdom of his proposed cure. In 1945, Friedrich Hayek posed the same question Wilson had more than a half century earlier: “Who is to do the planning” for society? He offered a more nuanced answer: while acknowledging that experts have an important role to play in advising lawmakers and implementing the policies they select, Hayek insisted that the “scientific knowledge[] [that] occupies now so prominent a place in public imagination . . . is not the only kind that is relevant.” We should remember that another kind of knowledge is critical, too: “The knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place. . . . We need to remember only how much we have to learn in any occupation after we have completed our theoretical training, how big a part of our working life we spend learning particular jobs, and how valuable an asset in all walks of life is knowledge of people, of local conditions, and special circumstances.”183

In time, the case made its way to the Supreme Court—and, once there, the justices united in throwing out Joseph’s conviction. Writing for the Court, Justice Robert H. Jackson explained that a criminal offense generally requires proof of an “evil-meaning mind” as well as “an evil-doing hand.” Put simply, with only limited exceptions, the government must show that the defendant committed a particular act (actus reus) with a particular mental state (mens rea). Because that hadn’t happened in Joseph’s case, the Court explained, his conviction couldn’t stand. The prosecution might have proved that he had committed a proscribed act, but it hadn’t proved that he had acted with anything worse than an innocent state of mind. The “evil-meaning mind” requirement was hardly something new or particular to Joseph’s case. It was, as Justice Jackson stressed, an ancient feature of Anglo-American law that rested on a “belief in freedom of the human will.”65 To choose to do something, our law has long recognized, is to embrace and endorse it, to make it part of your life’s story in a very different way than undertaking the same act innocently or accidentally. As a society steeped in respect for the individual, we have traditionally taken account of this in our criminal laws.

Fair Notice? If that’s one subtle shift in our criminal laws, here is another. Historically, English courts were loath to punish a man if he didn’t have fair notice of the law’s demands.74 In the United States, this fair notice promise was understood to inhere in the Constitution’s guarantee of due process of law.75 As Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote, “in a civilized state the least that can be expected of government is that it express its rules in language all can reasonably be expected to understand.”76 Like the mens rea requirement, the fair notice demand was long considered essential to the protection of individual liberty and intrinsic to the idea that just punishment follows blameworthy choices. One part of our law’s fair notice demand is expressed in vagueness doctrine. For centuries, judges have declined to enforce statutes or rules that are so vague that ordinary people cannot tell what conduct is out of bounds. The doctrine is still alive today, but the changed character of our criminal laws strains its ideals.77 Today, it’s not just that an ordinary person may have trouble understanding a particular law or a particular regulation. Fair notice problems now run deeper than that.

Nor is it always a defense when the government itself has approved your course of conduct. According to congressional testimony, the Environmental Protection Agency once created a hotline to field questions about a particularly complex law governing the disposal of hazardous waste. But there was a catch. The agency said it couldn’t guarantee the accuracy of its advice, and prosecutors said that reliance on the agency’s incorrect information wouldn’t qualify as a defense.81 Another agency, the Internal Revenue Service, for a period gave wrong answers about a third of the time to callers on its hotline. When asked about its error rate, agency officials reportedly, and without a hint of irony, “pointed to the growing complexity of the nation’s tax laws and the numerous and rapid tax-code changes that have been made in recent years.”82 That agency’s hit rate later improved to over 90 percent, but by then another issue arose: only a fraction of callers (11 percent in 2021) could get through to an agency representative.83

The rule of lenity played a prominent role in this country for most of our history. Spin through criminal cases from the founding era, and you will see it applied again and again by some of our most highly revered judges.92 But as with so much else, something has changed in recent years. “One of the oldest canons of interpretation” is now described by some scholars as an “afterthought or curiosity” in federal jurisprudence, “no more than a tie-breaker at best; a throwaway doctrine at worst.”93

Even old-fashioned searches are now easier. To search your home, the government still usually needs a warrant supported by probable cause of a crime. But when the menu of available crimes to pick from expands, the protection of the home diminishes.

Instead, the decision whether to bring the full force of the government’s penal powers to bear on an individual depends on the judgment of private citizens—peers of the accused who can look at the sum total of the evidence, including the government’s conduct, and decree whether a man deserves punishment. A jury’s verdict of acquittal is final; no official can appeal it. In a public trial, police and prosecutorial misconduct can be brought to light, dubious evidence tested, and official overreach turned aside. Really, it is another feature of our separation of powers designed to pit power against power to ensure that no one enjoys too much authority and the awesome might of the government is not abused. For just these sorts of reasons, Thomas Jefferson once said that he considered trial by jury “the only anchor, ever yet imagined by man, by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution.”125

But perhaps Zenger’s trial is a reminder of some of what can be lost when guilt is negotiated behind closed doors by officials who enjoy tremendous leverage and largely unreviewable discretion. These arrangements may be the result of good intentions in pursuit of useful social purposes. But the law of unintended consequences is an unforgiving one, and, as Justice Louis Brandeis once put it, “experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government’s purposes are beneficent.”131 When criminal offenses multiply, penalties mount, mens rea requirements disappear, and the force of vagueness doctrine and the rule of lenity recede, the intentions may be good ones, too. But tinker too much with the balance of power our Constitution envisioned and you risk ushering us into a precarious world.

In an effort to accommodate the county, the Masts offered to dispose of their household gray water using a mulch basin system. Employing that kind of technology, they said, would not offend their faith. And, they stressed, some twenty states authorize mulch basins for the disposal of gray water.17 The family also pointed out that, in Minnesota itself, thousands of campers, hunters, fishermen, and owners of rustic cabins are entirely exempt from gray water septic system mandates.

James Madison may not have anticipated the Masts’ plumbing problems, but he had firm convictions about what too much law means for ordinary people. As he saw it, a nation awash in rapidly changing laws is a nation destined to favor the few, the wealthy, and the well-connected at the expense of the many, the vulnerable, and the unpopular. Madison’s convictions on this score were the product of hard study. The first of twelve children, he was a voracious reader and eager student of history. One biographer noted that his education was grounded in the classics and the Bible and that he tried to “follow the lead of the Gospels in placing the individual at the heart of existence.”26

In preparing for the Convention, Madison compiled a list of “vices” in state and colonial political systems that he hoped the nation might avoid when drafting a new constitution. High on his list were the twin “evil[s]” of “multiplicity and mutability” in law. As he saw it, even in their “short period of independency,” some states already “ha[d] filled as many pages [of law] as the century which preceded it”; laws had changed so quickly that they were sometimes “repealed or superseded . . . even before a knowledge of them [could] reach[] the remoter districts within which they were to operate.”30 As he later argued in Federalist No. 62, a government that permits its laws to grow so exuberantly and change so often is nothing less than “poison[]” to “the blessings of liberty.” “The sagacious, the enterprising, and the moneyed few” may be able to track all the changes and even turn them to their benefit. But either way, they gain an “unreasonable advantage” over the “mass of the people.” And that is a path, he worried, sure to corrode and eventually shatter the “attachment and reverence” citizens hold for their institutions and law itself.

Howard pointed out some years ago that, according to the Small Business Administration, small businesses face annual regulatory costs 36 percent higher per employee than those faced by larger firms.45 Other studies echo that finding.46 Close to half of small-business owners say they have halted or delayed an investment or opportunity because of uncertainty over the regulatory landscape.47 As an opinion piece in The Washington Post put it, “for decades, large businesses have been taking market share from small businesses, and the corporations at the top of the pyramid have been consolidating into ever-bigger megacorporations.”48

Judge Douglas Ginsburg has explained the effect of regulatory capture on consumers this way: Regulation is an item of trade, supplied by politicians who traffic in the state’s monopoly on the use of force, and demanded by producers who can use regulation to extract rents from consumers. Regulation occurs because consumers, being numerous and each having a small stake in preventing it, are typically not organized as effectively as producers and hence systematically lose in the legislative struggle.

Either way, a 2015 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers and the U.S. Department of the Treasury found that onerous licensing regimes can not only reduce the total employment in a field, they can also lead to increased prices for goods and services and do so without “increas[ing] the quality of [those] goods and services.” The report further found that the burden of such schemes is often felt disproportionately. The report highlighted several groups that are especially disadvantaged: military spouses (who relocate frequently); immigrants (who may possess valuable talents but not the requisite funds or language skills to satisfy licensing constraints); and workers with a criminal record (whose record may foreclose licensing “regardless of whether the conviction is relevant to the license sought, how recent it was, or whether there were any extenuating circumstances”).146 Milton Friedman once declared “the overthrow of the medieval guild system . . . an indispensable early step in the rise of freedom in the Western world.”147 But looking at our contemporary licensing landscape, some might wonder exactly how far we’ve really come.

They know that it arose from a long philosophical and political development, one unique in world history.

As implied by the old jingle, If it moves, salute it. If it doesn’t move, pick it up. If you can’t pick it up, paint it! the phenomenon involves ritualistic observance of the dominance-submission relationships of the military hierarchy, extreme orderliness and a preoccupation with outward appearances. In this latter respect it is the extension of a commonplace tendency in most human societies—that of taking outward show as the criterion according to which most judgments are made. This reliance on externals and constant urge to ‘keep up appearances’ may well have its origins in three features of very early childhood.

There are, of course, good arguments for ‘bull’: that it ensures a level of orderliness, cleanliness, discipline, personal pride, obedience and morale which, so it seems, could not be reached by any other means, i.e., by reasoned as opposed to compulsive behaviour. By the same token it achieves a level of uniformity that makes for solidarity and group cohesiveness. However, the case against it is also strong. It is time-wasting, excruciatingly boring for all those with more than the most mediocre intellect, and a poor substitute for thought. Since it aims to govern behaviour by a set of rules and defines a rigid programme for different occasions, it cannot meet the unanticipated event. This may have fatal consequences, such as the possibility of admirals standing stiffly to attention, hands at the salute, while their battleships sink slowly under them. But for ‘bull’ they might have done something rather more useful in their last remaining moments of buoyancy.

What started as a functionally useful manoeuvre becomes a highly stereotyped pattern of movements on the barrack square. In itself this may be no bad thing. Ceremonial can be pleasing to the eye, an anodyne for tax-payers and even, on occasions, a device for raising charitable funds. But unfortunately ceremonial drill, like other forms of ‘bull’, is addictive and, by being so, usurps the time and energy which should be devoted to other more adaptive pastimes.

This of course begs several questions. It confuses loss of initiative and blind obedience with the building of character, and makes the unwarranted assumption that naval ratings face greater danger than many civilians, including merchant seamen, steeplejacks, racing motorists, mountain-climbers, single-handed yachtsmen, coal-miners and matadors, not one of whom has to fortify his character by polishing brass or scrubbing wood.

What about speed? In some ways, Quibi was very fast. Starting from scratch, it built up a large library of new content and a complete technology infrastructure in a year and a half. But this is not the kind of speed that matters to business geeks. In the geek way, speed doesn’t mean velocity; it instead means the cadence at which a company can iterate. Speed refers to how quickly a team can build something, get it in front of a customer or otherwise test it in real-world conditions, get feedback, and fold that feedback into the next version. As we saw earlier in this chapter, one of Planet’s advantages over incumbents like NASA is its ability to iterate with a cycle time of months instead of years.

Even down to my birth-century that poison was still in the blood of Christendom, and the best of English commoners was still content to see his inferiors impudently continuing to hold a number of positions, such as lordships and the throne, to which the grotesque laws of his country did not allow him to aspire; in fact, he was not merely contented with this strange condition of things, he was even able to persuade himself that he was proud of it. It seems to show that there isn’t anything you can’t stand, if you are only born and bred to it. Of course that taint, that reverence for rank and title, had been in our American blood, too—I know that; but when I left America it had disappeared—at least to all intents and purposes.

You see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to one’s country, not to its institutions or its office-holders. The country is the real thing, the substantial thing, the eternal thing; it is the thing to watch over, and care for, and be loyal to; institutions are extraneous, they are its mere clothing, and clothing can wear out, become ragged, cease to be comfortable, cease to protect the body from winter, disease, and death. To be loyal to rags, to shout for rags, to worship rags, to die for rags—that is a loyalty of unreason, it is pure animal; it belongs to monarchy, was invented by monarchy; let monarchy keep it. I was from Connecticut, whose Constitution declares “that all political power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their benefit; and that they have at all times an undeniable and indefeasible right to alter their form of government in such a manner as they may think expedient.”

I was so impressed with this, that sometimes when she began to empty one of these sentences on me I unconsciously took the very attitude of reverence, and stood uncovered; and if words had been water, I had been drowned, sure. She had exactly the German way; whatever was in her mind to be delivered, whether a mere remark, or a sermon, or a cyclopedia, or the history of a war, she would get it into a single sentence or die.

The blunting effects of slavery upon the slaveholder’s moral perceptions are known and conceded, the world over; and a privileged class, an aristocracy, is but a band of slaveholders under another name. This has a harsh sound, and yet should not be offensive to any—even to the noble himself—unless the fact itself be an offense: for the statement simply formulates a fact. The repulsive feature of slavery is the thing , not its name. One needs but to hear an aristocrat speak of the classes that are below him to recognize—and in but indifferently modified measure—the very air and tone of the actual slaveholder; and behind these are the slaveholder’s spirit, the slaveholder’s blunted feeling. They are the result of the same cause in both cases: the possessor’s old and inbred custom of regarding himself as a superior being.

It has been a complex journey, for both societies believe they represent unique values. American exceptionalism is missionary. It holds that the United States has an obligation to spread its values to every part of the world. China’s exceptionalism is cultural. China does not proselytize; it does not claim that its contemporary institutions are relevant outside China. But it is the heir of the Middle Kingdom tradition, which formally graded all other states as various levels of tributaries based on their approximation to Chinese cultural and political forms; in other words, a kind of cultural universality. A primary focus of this book is the interaction between Chinese and American leaders since the People’s Republic of China was founded in 1949. Both in and out of government, I have kept records of my conversations with four generations of Chinese leaders and have drawn on them as a primary source in writing this book.

No one in Mao’s audience—the Communist Party leadership of a revolutionary “New China” proclaiming its intent to remake the international order and abolish China’s own feudal past—seems to have questioned the relevance of these ancient precedents to China’s current strategic imperatives. Planning for an attack continued on the basis of the principles Mao had outlined. Weeks later the offensive proceeded much as he described: China executed a sudden, devastating blow on the Indian positions and then retreated to the previous line of control, even going so far as to return the captured Indian heavy weaponry.

In no other country is it conceivable that a modern leader would initiate a major national undertaking by invoking strategic principles from a millennium-old event—nor that he could confidently expect his colleagues to understand the significance of his allusions. Yet China is singular. No other country can claim so long a continuous civilization, or such an intimate link to its ancient past and classical principles of strategy and statesmanship. Other societies, the United States included, have claimed universal applicability for their values and institutions. Still, none equals China in persisting—and persuading its neighbors to acquiesce—in such an elevated conception of its world role for so long, and in the face of so many historical vicissitudes. From the emergence of China as a unified state in the third century B.C. until the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1912, China stood at the center of an East Asian international system of remarkable durability. The Chinese Emperor was conceived of (and recognized by most neighboring states) as the pinnacle of a universal political hierarchy, with all other states’ rulers theoretically serving as vassals. Chinese language, culture, and political institutions were the hallmarks of civilization, such that even regional rivals and foreign conquerors adopted them to varying degrees as a sign of their own legitimacy (often as a first step to being subsumed within China).

Can strategic trust replace a system of strategic threats? Strategic trust is treated by many as a contradiction in terms. Strategists rely on the intentions of the presumed adversary only to a limited extent. For intentions are subject to change. And the essence of sovereignty is the right to make decisions not subject to another authority. A certain amount of threat based on capabilities is therefore inseparable from the relations of sovereign states.

Disputes between the North Atlantic states tend to focus on divergent assessments of international issues and the means of dealing with them; even at their most bitter, they retain the character of an interfamily dispute. Soft power and multilateral diplomacy are the dominant tools of foreign policy, and for some Western European states, military action is all but excluded as a legitimate instrument of state policy. In Asia, by contrast, the states consider themselves in potential confrontation with their neighbors. It is not that they necessarily plan on war; they simply do not exclude it. If they are too weak for self-defense, they seek to make themselves part of an alliance system that provides additional protection, as in the case with ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Sovereignty, in many cases regained relatively recently after periods of foreign colonization, has an absolute character. The principles of the Westphalian system prevail, more so than on their continent of origin. The concept of sovereignty is considered paramount. Aggression is defined as the movement of organized military units across borders. Noninterference in domestic affairs is taken as a fundamental principle of interstate relations. In a state system so organized, diplomacy seeks to preserve the key elements of the balance of power.

In 1907, a senior official in the British Foreign Office, Eyre Crowe, wrote a brilliant analysis of the European political structure and Germany’s rise. The key question he raised, and which has acute relevance today, is whether the crisis that led to World War I was caused by Germany’s rise, evoking a kind of organic resistance to the emergence of a new and powerful force, or whether it was caused by specific and, hence, avoidable German policies.1 Was the crisis caused by German capabilities or German conduct?

No matter what the German government’s professions were, the result would be “as formidable a menace to the rest of the world as would be presented by any deliberate conquest of a similar position by ‘malice aforethought.’”5 Even if moderate German statesmen were to demonstrate their bona fides, moderate German foreign policy could “at any stage merge into” a conscious scheme for hegemony.

Were Crowe to analyze the contemporary scene, he might emerge with a judgment comparable to his 1907 report. I will sketch that interpretation, though it differs substantially from my own, because it approximates a view widely held on both sides of the Pacific. The United States and China have been not so much nation-states as continental expressions of cultural identities. Both have historically been driven to visions of universality by their economic and political achievements and their people’s irrepressible energy and self-confidence. Both Chinese and American governments have frequently assumed a seamless identity between their national policies and the general interests of mankind. Crowe might warn that when two such entities encounter each other on the world stage significant tension is probable. Whatever China’s intentions, the Crowe school of thought would treat a successful Chinese “rise” as incompatible with America’s position in the Pacific and by extension the world.

China, fulfilling its own interpretation of its national destiny, will continue to develop its economy and pursue a broad range of interests in Asia and beyond.

An aspect of strategic tension in the current world situation resides in the Chinese fear that America is seeking to contain China—paralleled by the American concern that China is seeking to expel the United States from Asia. The concept of a Pacific Community—a region to which the United States, China, and other states all belong and in whose peaceful development all participate—could ease both fears. It would make the United States and China part of a common enterprise. Shared purposes—and the elaboration of them—would replace strategic uneasiness to some extent. It would enable other major countries such as Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam, India, and Australia to participate in the construction of a system perceived as joint rather than polarized between “Chinese” and “American” blocs. Such an effort could be meaningful only if it engaged the full attention, and above all the conviction, of the leaders concerned.

The economy of the Soviet Union was weak—except for military production—and without impact on the global economy. Once China broke off ties and ejected Soviet advisers, few countries except those forcibly absorbed into the Soviet orbit had a significant stake in their economic relationship with Moscow. Contemporary China, by contrast, is a dynamic element in the world economy. It is a principal trading partner of all of its neighbors and most of the Western industrial powers, including the United States—a fact bound to affect all nations’ calculations and their conduct in any hypothetical contest.

This is why the “pivot” to Asia announced by the Obama administration in late 2011 raised the question whether American national interests in Europe had lessened to benefit Asia. But global equilibrium abhors a vacuum; American strategy must be viewed as remaining global in nature.

For nearly two generations, American strategy relied on local regional defense by American ground forces—largely to avoid the catastrophic consequences of general nuclear war. Since then, congressional and public opinion have impelled an end to such commitments in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Now fiscal considerations further limit the range of such a strategy. American strategy has been redesigned from territorial defense to imposing unacceptable risks on potential aggressors, though not necessarily at the geographic point of attack. This requires forces capable of rapid intervention and global reach but not bases ringing China’s frontiers. It remains to be seen whether even the former goal is achievable by a defense policy based on budgetary restraints.

The world order, as concurrently constituted, was built largely without Chinese participation. Hence China feels less bound by rules in the creation of which it did not participate. Where the result does not suit Chinese preferences, Beijing has set up alternate arrangements, such as in the separate currency channels being established with Japan and Brazil and other countries.

As they pursue this process, both sides need to recognize the impact of rhetoric on perceptions and calculations. American leaders occasionally launch broadsides against China—including specific implications of adversarial policies—as domestic political necessities. This occurs even when—perhaps especially when—a moderate policy is the ultimate intention. The issue is not specific disputes, which should be dealt with on the merits of the issue, but attacks on the basic motivations of Chinese policy. Institutional posturing risks turning on itself. For the target of these attacks is bound to ask itself whether domestic imperatives requiring affirmations of hostility will sooner or later impose hostile actions. By the same token, threatening Chinese statements—including those in the semi-official press—are likely to be interpreted in terms of actions they imply, whatever the domestic pressures or intent that generated them.

The American debate, on both sides of the political divide, often describes China as a “rising power” that will need to “mature” and learn how to exercise responsibility on the world stage. China, however, does not see itself as a rising, but as a returning power, in Chinese eyes displaced temporarily by colonial exploiters taking advantage of Chinese domestic strife and decay. It does not view the prospect of a strong China exercising influence in economic, cultural, political, and military affairs as an unnatural challenge to world order but rather as a return to a normal state of affairs. Americans need not agree with the Chinese analysis to understand that lecturing a country with a history of millennia about its need to “grow up” can be needlessly grating.

This book does not predict that the United States and China will necessarily transcend the ordinary operation of great-power rivalry or of ideological disagreement. It argues that the two countries owe it to themselves and the world to attempt to do so. The practice of coevolution will take wisdom and patience. After some time, it may grow into an integral part of each country’s conduct. If such an effort fails, it will be because, on one side or both, the inevitable uncertainty surrounding the intentions of sovereign states was deemed insurmountable, and the weight of history overwhelmed the imperative for a new departure. In that case, the United States will defend its interests by traditional precepts. But the advocates of confrontation will not be vindicated by such an outcome. Those who inherit the ensuing conflict will still be obliged to produce a new and better world order when the crisis abates. In the end, history lauds not conflicts of societies but their reconciliations.

The famous opening of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a fourteenth-century epic novel treasured by centuries of Chinese (including Mao, who is said to have pored over it almost obsessively in his youth), evokes this continuous rhythm: “The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been.”3 Each period of disunity was viewed as an aberration. Each new dynasty reached back to the previous dynasty’s principles of governance in order to reestablish continuity.

China produced no religious themes in the Western sense at all. The Chinese never generated a myth of cosmic creation. Their universe was created by the Chinese themselves, whose values, even when declared of universal applicability, were conceived of as Chinese in origin. The predominant values of Chinese society were derived from the prescriptions of an ancient philosopher known to posterity as Kong Fu-zi (or “Confucius” in the Latinized version).

Confucius’s answer to the chaos of his era was the “Way” of the just and harmonious society, which, he taught, had once been realized before—in a distant Chinese golden age. Mankind’s central spiritual task was to re-create this proper order already on the verge of being lost. Spiritual fulfillment was a task not so much of revelation or liberation but patient recovery of forgotten principles of self-restraint. The goal was rectification, not progress.17 Learning was the key to advancement in a Confucian society. Thus Confucius taught that [l]ove of kindness, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by foolishness. Love of knowledge, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by loose speculation. Love of honesty, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by harmful candour. Love of straightforwardness, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by misdirected judgment. Love of daring, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by insubordination. And love for strength of character, without a love to learn, finds itself obscured by intractability.18

The Great Wall, so prominent in Western iconography of China, was a reflection of this basic vulnerability, though rarely a successful solution to it. Instead, Chinese statesmen relied on a rich array of diplomatic and economic instruments to draw potentially hostile foreigners into relationships the Chinese could manage. The highest aspiration was less to conquer (though China occasionally mounted major military campaigns) than to deter invasion and prevent the formation of barbarian coalitions.

Through trade incentives and skillful use of political theater, China coaxed neighboring peoples into observing the norms of Chinese centrality while projecting an image of awesome majesty to deter potential invaders from testing China’s strength. Its goal was not to conquer and subjugate the barbarians but to “rule [them] with a loose rein” (ji mi). For those who would not obey, China would exploit divisions among them, famously “using barbarians to check barbarians” and, when necessary, “using barbarians to attack barbarians.”25 For as a Ming Dynasty official wrote of the potentially threatening tribes on China’s northeastern frontier: [I]f the tribes are divided among themselves they [will remain] weak and [it will be] easy to hold them in subjection; if the tribes are separated they shun each other and readily obey. We favor one or other [of their chieftains] and permit them to fight each other. This is a principle of political action which asserts: “Wars between the ‘barbarians’ are auspicious for China.”26

The most remarkable expression of China’s fundamental pragmatism was its reaction to conquerors. When foreign dynasts prevailed in battle, the Chinese bureaucratic elite would offer their services and appeal to their conquerors on the premise that so vast and unique a land as they had just overrun could be ruled only by use of Chinese methods, Chinese language, and the existing Chinese bureaucracy. With each generation, the conquerors would find themselves increasingly assimilated into the order they had sought to dominate. Eventually their own home territories—the launching points for their invasions—would come to be regarded as part of China itself. They would find themselves pursuing traditional Chinese national interests, with the project of conquest effectively turned on its head.29

Where the skillful chess player aims to eliminate his opponent’s pieces in a series of head-on clashes, a talented wei qi player moves into “empty” spaces on the board, gradually mitigating the strategic potential of his opponent’s pieces.

What distinguishes Sun Tzu from Western writers on strategy is the emphasis on the psychological and political elements over the purely military. The great European military theorists Carl von Clausewitz and Antoine-Henri Jomini treat strategy as an activity in its own right, separate from politics. Even Clausewitz’s famous dictum that war is the continuation of politics by other means implies that with war the statesman enters a new and distinct phase. Sun Tzu merges the two fields. Where Western strategists reflect on the means to assemble superior power at the decisive point, Sun Tzu addresses the means of building a dominant political and psychological position, such that the outcome of a conflict becomes a foregone conclusion. Western strategists test their maxims by victories in battles; Sun Tzu tests by victories where battles have become unnecessary.

For China’s classical sages, the world could never be conquered; wise rulers could hope only to harmonize with its trends. There was no New World to populate, no redemption awaiting mankind on distant shores. The promised land was China, and the Chinese were already there. The blessings of the Middle Kingdom’s culture might theoretically be extended, by China’s superior example, to the foreigners on the empire’s periphery. But there was no glory to be found in venturing across the seas to convert “heathens” to Chinese ways; the customs of the Celestial Dynasty were plainly beyond the attainment of the far barbarians.

The notion of free trade, resident embassies, and sovereign equality—by this point, the minimum rights enjoyed by Europeans in almost every other corner of the world—were unheard of in China. One tacit exception had been made for Russia. Its rapid eastward expansion (the Czar’s domains now abutted Qing territories in Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Manchuria) placed it in a unique position to threaten China. The Qing Dynasty, in 1715, permitted the establishment of a Russian Orthodox mission in Beijing; it eventually took on the role of a de facto embassy, the only foreign mission of its kind in China for over a century. The contacts extended to Western European traders, limited as they were, were seen by the Qing as a considerable indulgence.

But the Western powers were not so easily soothed. Every Chinese concession tended to generate additional Western demands. The treaties, conceived at first as a temporary concession, instead inaugurated a process by which the Qing court lost control of much of China’s commercial and foreign policy. Following the British treaty, U.S. President John Tyler promptly sent a mission to China to gain similar concessions for the Americans, the forerunner of the later “Open Door” policy. The French negotiated their own treaty with analogous terms. Each of these countries in turn included a “Most Favored Nation” clause that stipulated that any concession offered by China to other countries must also be given to the signatory.

From the east it set out not only to occupy significant portions of Chinese territory, but to supplant Beijing as the center of a new East Asian international order.

To weather the storm, China relied not on technology or military power but instead on two deeply traditional resources: the analytical abilities of its diplomats, and the endurance and cultural confidence of its people. It developed ingenious strategies for playing off the new barbarians against one another. Officials charged with managing China’s foreign relations offered concessions in various cities—but they deliberately invited multiple sets of foreigners to share in the spoils, so that they could “use barbarians against barbarians” and avoid dominance by any one power. They eventually insisted on scrupulous adherence to the “unequal treaties” with the West and to foreign principles of international law, not because Chinese officials believed them to be valid, but because such conduct provided a means to circumscribe foreign ambitions. Faced with two potentially overwhelming contenders for dominance in northeast China, and possessing almost no force with which to repulse them, China’s diplomats set Russia and Japan against each other, mitigating to some degree the scope and permanence of the encroachments by each of them.

One of the classic tales of the Chinese strategic tradition was that of Zhuge Liang’s “Empty City Stratagem” from The Romance of the Three Kingdoms. In it, a commander notices an approaching army far superior to his own. Since resistance guarantees destruction, and surrender would bring about loss of control over the future, the commander opts for a stratagem. He opens the gates of his city, places himself there in a posture of repose, playing a lute, and behind him shows normal life without any sign of panic or concern. The general of the invading army interprets this sangfroid as a sign of the existence of hidden reserves, stops his advance, and withdraws.

In pursuit of this foreign policy agenda, Mao owed more to Sun Tzu than to Lenin. He drew inspiration from his reading of the Chinese classics and the tradition he outwardly disdained. In charting foreign policy initiatives he was less likely to refer to Marxist doctrine than to traditional Chinese works: Confucian texts; the canonical “24 Dynastic Histories” recounting the rise and fall of China’s imperial dynasties; Sun Tzu, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and other texts on warfare and strategy; tales of adventure and rebellion such as Outlaws of the Marsh; and the novel of romance and courtly intrigue, Dream of the Red Chamber, which Mao claimed to have read five times.10 In an echo of the traditional Confucian scholar-officials whom he denounced as oppressors and parasites, Mao wrote poetry and philosophical essays and took great pride in his unorthodox calligraphy. These literary and artistic elements were not a refuge from his political labors but an integral part of them. When Mao, after a thirty-two-year absence, returned to his native village in 1959, he wrote a poem not of Marxism or materialism but of romantic sweep: “It is the bitter sacrifices that strengthen our firm resolve, and which give us the courage to dare to change heavens and skies, to change the sun, and to make a new world.”11

Applied to the interplay of three countries, one would therefore think that it is always desirable to be in a group of two.

Mao added a novel dimension to power politics, one for which I know of no precedent. Far from seeking the support of either superpower—as traditional balance-of-power theory would have counseled—he exploited the Soviet-U.S. fear of each other by challenging each of the rivals simultaneously.

The Eisenhower administration dealt with the threat of aggression by methods borrowed from America’s European experience. It tried to shore up the viability of countries bordering the Communist world following the example of the Marshall Plan, and it constructed military alliances in the style of NATO, such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) between the new nations bordering China in Southeast Asia. It did not fully consider the essential difference between European conditions and those at the fringe of Asia. The postwar European countries were established states with elaborated institutions. Their viability depended on closing the gap between expectation and reality, caused by the depredations of the Second World War—an expansive project that proved manageable, however, in a relatively brief period of time as history is measured. With domestic stability substantially assured, the security problem turned into defense against a potential military attack across established international frontiers. In Asia around the rim of China, however, the states were still in the process of formation. The challenge was to create political institutions and a political consensus out of ethnic and religious divisions. This was less a military, more a conceptual, task; the security threat was domestic insurrection or guerrilla warfare rather than organized units crossing military frontiers.

The conference created a novel and paradoxical grouping: the alignment of the Non-Aligned. Mao had sought Soviet support as a counterweight to potential American pressure on China in pursuit of American hegemony in Asia. But concurrently he tried to organize the Non-Aligned into a safety net against Soviet hegemony. In that sense, almost from the beginning, the two Communist giants were competing with each other.

The Soviet Union had just launched Sputnik—the first orbiting satellite—and the meeting was dominated by the belief, shared then by many in the West, that Soviet technology and power were ascendant. Mao adopted this notion, declaring pungently that the “East Wind” now prevailed over the “West Wind.” But he drew from the apparent relative decline of American power a conclusion uncomfortable for his Soviet allies, namely that China was in an increasingly strong position to assert its autonomy: “Their real purpose,” Mao later told his doctor, “is to control us. They’re trying to tie our hands and feet. But they’re full of wishful thinking, like idiots talking about their dreams.”26

Many of these suddenly unconstrained youths joined factions of the Red Guards, youth militias bonded by ideological fervor, operating above the law and outside of (and often in explicit opposition to) ordinary institutional structures. Mao endorsed their efforts with vague but incendiary slogans, such as “To rebel is justified” and “Bombard the headquarters.”20 He approved their violent attacks on the existing Communist Party bureaucracy and traditional social mores and encouraged them not to fear “disorder” as they fought to eradicate the dreaded “Four Olds”—old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits—that, in Maoist thinking, had kept China weak.21 The People’s Daily fanned the flames by editorializing “In Praise of Lawlessness”—an explicit, government-sanctioned rebuke to China’s millennial tradition of harmony and order.22 The result was a spectacular human and institutional carnage, as one by one China’s organs of power and authority—including the highest ranks of the Communist Party—succumbed to the assaults of teenage ideological shock troops. China—a civilization heretofore known for its respect for learning and erudition—became an upside-down world, with children turning on parents, students brutalizing teachers and burning books, and professionals and high officials sent down to farms and factories to learn revolutionary practice from illiterate peasants. Scenes of cruelty unfolded across the country, as Red Guards and citizens allied to them—some simply picking a faction at random in the hope of surviving the storm—turned their fury on any target that might conceivably augur a return of the old “feudal” order to China.

A challenge of the modern period is that issues have become so complex that the legal framework is increasingly impenetrable. The political system issues directives but the execution is left, to an ever larger degree, to bureaucracies separated from both the political process and the public, whose only control is periodic elections, if that. Even in the United States, major legislative acts often comprise thousands of pages that, to put it mildly, only the fewest legislators have read in detail. Especially in Communist states, bureaucracies operate in self-contained units with their own rules in pursuance of procedures they often define for themselves. Fissures open up between the political and the bureaucratic classes and between both of those and the general public. In this manner, a new mandarin class risks emerging by bureaucratic momentum. Mao’s attempt to solve the problem in one grand assault nearly wrecked Chinese society. But among younger generations of Chinese, one now sometimes hears the view that the Cultural Revolution provided a sense of common spiritual experience missing in the contemporary era.

Chinese negotiators use diplomacy to weave together political, military, and psychological elements into an overall strategic design. Diplomacy to them is the elaboration of a strategic principle. They ascribe no particular significance to the process of negotiation as such; nor do they consider the opening of a particular negotiation a transformational event. They do not think that personal relations can affect their judgments, though they may invoke personal ties to facilitate their own efforts. They have no emotional difficulty with deadlocks; they consider them the inevitable mechanism of diplomacy. They prize gestures of goodwill only if they serve a definable objective or tactic. And they patiently take the long view against impatient interlocutors, making time their ally.

The attitude of the American diplomat varies substantially. The prevalent view within the American body politic sees military force and diplomacy as distinct, in essence separate, phases of action. Military action is viewed as occasionally creating the conditions for negotiations, but once negotiations begin, they are seen as being propelled by their own internal logic. This is why, at the start of negotiations, the United States reduced military operations in Korea and agreed to a bombing halt in Vietnam, in each case substituting reassurance for pressure and reducing material incentives on behalf of intangible ones. American diplomacy generally prefers the specific over the general, the practical over the abstract. It is urged to be “flexible”; it feels an obligation to break deadlocks with new proposals—unintentionally inviting new deadlocks to elicit new proposals. These tactics often can be used by determined adversaries in the service of a strategy of procrastination.

Mao’s passion strove to overwhelm opposition; Zhou’s intellect would seek to persuade or outmaneuver it. Mao was sardonic; Zhou penetrating. Mao thought of himself as a philosopher; Zhou saw his role as an administrator or a negotiator. Mao was eager to accelerate history; Zhou was content to exploit its currents. A saying he often repeated was “The helmsman must ride with the waves.” When they were together, there was no question of the hierarchy, not simply in the formal sense but in the deeper aspect of Zhou’s extraordinarily deferential conduct.

It was, however, a hardheaded, unsentimental perception of friendship. The Chinese Communist leadership retained some of the traditional approach to barbarian management. In it, the other side is flattered by being admitted to the Chinese “club” as an “old friend,” a posture that makes disagreement more complicated and confrontations painful.

Negotiations had now reached the point where the diplomat has a choice to make. One tactic—and indeed the traditional approach—is to outline one’s maximum position and gradually retreat to a more attainable stance. Such a tactic is much beloved by negotiators eager to protect their domestic standing. Yet while it appears “tough” to start with an extreme set of demands, the process amounts to a progressive weakening ushered in by the abandonment of the opening move. The other party is tempted to dig in at each stage to see what the next modification will bring and to turn the negotiating process into a test of endurance. Rather than exalting process over substance, the preferable course is to make opening proposals close to what one judges to be the most sustainable outcome, a definition of “sustainable” in the abstract being one that both sides have an interest in maintaining.

The reader should keep in mind that the kind of protocol and hospitality described here has evolved substantially in the decades since.

The Soviet Union, Mao told me, represented a global threat that needed to be resisted globally. Whatever any other nation might do, China would resist an attack, even if its forces had to retire into the interior of the country to fight a guerrilla war. But cooperation with the United States and other likeminded countries would speed the victory in the struggle whose outcome was predetermined by the long-term weakness of the Soviet Union. China would not ask for help nor make its cooperation conditional on the cooperation of others. But it was prepared to adopt parallel strategies, especially with the United States. The bond would be common convictions, not formal obligations.

Two strands of policy had been competing with each other through the turbulences of Mao’s rule. There was the revolutionary thrust that saw China as a moral and political force, insisting on dispensing its unique precepts by example to an awestruck world. There was the geopolitical China coolly assessing trends and manipulating them to its own advantage. There was a China seeking coalitions for the first time in its history but also the one defiantly challenging the entire world. Mao had taken a war-wracked country and maneuvered it between competing domestic factions, hostile superpowers, an ambivalent Third World, and suspicious neighbors. He managed to have China participate in each overlapping concentric circle but commit itself to none. China had survived wars, tensions, and doubts while its influence grew, and in the end, it became an emerging superpower whose Communist form of government survived the collapse of the Communist world. Mao achieved this at horrendous cost by relying on the tenacity and perseverance of the Chinese people, using their endurance and cohesion, which so often exasperated him, as the bedrock of his edifice.

Deng stressed the importance of decentralization in a vast country with a huge population and significant regional differences. But this was not the principal challenge, he said. Modern technology had to be introduced to China, tens of thousands of Chinese students would be sent abroad (“We have nothing to fear from Western education”), and the abuses of the Cultural Revolution would be ended once and for all. While Deng had not raised his voice, the tables around us had fallen silent. The other Chinese present were sitting at the edge of their seats, not even pretending not to be listening in on the old man as he outlined his vision of their future. “We have to get it right this time,” concluded Deng. “We have made too many mistakes already.” Soon after, Hua faded from the leadership.

China had invaded Vietnam to “teach it a lesson” after Vietnamese troops had occupied Cambodia in response to a series of border clashes with the Khmer Rouge, which had taken over Cambodia in 1975, and in ultimate pursuit of Hanoi’s goal of creating an Indochinese Federation. China had done so in defiance of a mutual defense treaty between Hanoi and Moscow, signed less than a month earlier. The war had been extremely costly to the Chinese armed forces, not yet fully restored from the depredations of the Cultural Revolution.2 But the invasion served its fundamental objective: when the Soviet Union failed to respond it demonstrated the limitations of its strategic reach. From that point of view, it can be considered a turning point of the Cold War, though it was not fully understood as such at the time.

Freed from the necessity of feigning Communist solidarity in the face of the American “imperialist” threat, the adversaries moved into open opposition to each other soon after the fall of Saigon in April 1975. Within six months of the fall of all of Indochina, 150,000 Vietnamese were forced to leave Cambodia. A comparable number of ethnically Chinese Vietnamese citizens were obliged to flee Vietnam. By February 1976, China ended its aid program to Vietnam, and a year later, it cut off any deliveries based on existing programs. Concurrently, Hanoi moved toward the Soviet Union. At a meeting of the Vietnamese Politburo in June 1978, China was identified as Vietnam’s “principal enemy.” The same month, Vietnam joined Comecon, the Soviet-led trade bloc. In November 1978, the Soviet Union and Vietnam signed the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, which contained military clauses. In December 1978, Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia, overthrowing the Khmer Rouge and installing a pro-Vietnamese government. Ideology had disappeared from the conflict. The Communist power centers were conducting a balance-of-power contest based not on ideology but on national interest.

A principal difference between Chinese and Western diplomatic strategy is the reaction to perceived vulnerability. American and Western diplomats conclude that they should move carefully to avoid provocation; Chinese response is more likely to magnify defiance. Western diplomats tend to conclude from an unfavorable balance of forces an imperative for a diplomatic solution; they urge diplomatic initiatives to place the other side in the “wrong” to isolate it morally but to desist from the use of force—this was essentially the American advice to Deng after Vietnam invaded Cambodia and occupied it. Chinese strategists are more likely to increase their commitment to substitute courage and psychological pressure against the material advantage of the adversary. They believe in deterrence in the form of preemption. When Chinese planners conclude that their opponent is gaining unacceptable advantage and that the strategic trend is turning against them, they respond by seeking to undermine the enemy’s confidence and allow China to reclaim the psychological, if not material, upper hand.

Deng’s prediction that the Soviet Union would not attack China was borne out. The day after China launched its invasion, the Soviet government released a lukewarm statement that, while condemning China’s “criminal” attack, emphasized that “the heroic Vietnamese people… is capable of standing up for itself this time again[.]”50 The Soviet military response was limited to sending a naval task force to the South China Sea, undertaking a limited arms airlift to Hanoi, and stepping up air patrols along the Sino-Soviet border. The airlift was constrained by geography but also by internal hesitations. In the end, the Soviet Union gave as much support in 1979 to its new ally, Vietnam, as it had extended twenty years earlier to its then ally, China, in the Taiwan Strait Crises. In neither case would the Soviet Union run any risks of a wider war.

The conventional wisdom among historians is that the war was a costly Chinese failure.53 The effects of the PLA’s politicization during the Cultural Revolution became apparent during the campaign: hampered by outdated equipment, logistical problems, personnel shortages, and inflexible tactics, Chinese forces advanced slowly and at great cost. By some analysts’ estimates, the PLA suffered as many killed in action in one month of fighting the Third Vietnam War as the United States suffered in the most costly years of the second one.54

In practice, a vacuum exists for the first nine months or so of the incoming administration, in which it is obliged to act by improvisation or on the recommendations of holdover personnel, as it gradually adjusts to exercising its own authority. The inevitable learning period is complicated by the desire of the new administration to legitimize its rise to office by alleging that all inherited problems are the policy faults of its predecessor and not inherent problems; they are deemed soluble and in a finite time. Continuity of policy becomes a secondary consideration if not an invidious claim. Since new Presidents have just won an election campaign, they may also overestimate the range of flexibility that objective circumstances permit or rely excessively on their persuasive power. For countries relying on American policy, the perpetual psychodrama of democratic transitions is a constant invitation to hedge their bets.

Before Tiananmen, America had become familiar with the debate about the role of its diplomacy in promoting democracy. In simplified form, the debate pitted idealists against realists—idealists insisting that domestic systems affect foreign policy and are therefore legitimate items on the diplomatic agenda, realists arguing that such an agenda is beyond any country’s capacity and that diplomacy should therefore focus primarily on external policies. The absolutes of moral precept were weighed against the contingencies of deducing foreign policy from the balancing of national interests. The actual distinctions are more subtle. Idealists, when they seek to apply their values, will be driven to consider the world of specific circumstance. Thoughtful realists understand that values are an important component of reality. When decisions are made, the distinction is rarely absolute; often it comes down to a question of nuance.

There was a time when a Chinese leader’s abjuring a crusading role for Communist ideology would have been greeted by the democratic world as proof of a beneficent evolution. Now that the heirs of Mao were arguing that the age of ideology was over and that national interest was the determinant, eminent Americans were insisting that democratic institutions were required to guarantee a compatibility of national interests. That proposition—verging on an article of faith for many American analysts—would be difficult to demonstrate from historical experience. When World War I started, most governments in Europe (including Britain, France, and Germany) were governed by essentially democratic institutions. Nevertheless, World War I—a catastrophe from which Europe has never fully recovered—was enthusiastically approved by all elected parliaments.

Jiang used my 1990 visit for precisely such a discourse. He and other Chinese leaders kept insisting on what would have been conventional wisdom as late as five years earlier: that China and the United States should work together on a new international order—based on principles comparable to those of the traditional European state system since 1648. In other words, domestic arrangements were beyond the scope of foreign policy. Relations between states were governed by principles of national interest. That proposition was exactly what the new political dispensation in the West was jettisoning. The new concept insisted that the world was entering a “post-sovereign” era, in which international norms of human rights would prevail over the traditional prerogatives of sovereign governments. By contrast Jiang and his associates sought a multipolar world that accepted China’s brand of hybrid socialism and “people’s democracy,” and in which the United States treated China on equal terms as a great power.

When I visited China again in 1992, Qian Qichen described the collapse of the Soviet Union as “like the aftermath of an explosion—shock waves in all directions.” The collapse of the Soviet Union had indeed created a new geopolitical context. As Beijing and Washington assessed the new landscape, they found their interests no longer as evidently congruent as in the days of near alliance. Then, disagreements had been mainly over the tactics of resisting Soviet hegemony. Now, as the common opponent withered, it was inevitable that the differences in the two leaderships’ values and worldviews would come to the fore.

Nor did China’s leaders accept the interpretation of the end of the Cold War as ushering in a period of America as a hyperpower. In a 1991 conversation, Qian Qichen cautioned that the new international order could not remain unipolar indefinitely and that China would work toward a multipolar world—which meant that it would work to counter American preeminence. He cited demographic realities—including a somewhat threatening reference to China’s massive population advantage—to bolster his point: We believe it is impossible that such a unipolar world would come into existence. Some people seem to believe that after the end of the Gulf War and the Cold War, the U.S. can do anything. I don’t think that is correct.… In the Muslim world there are over 1 billion people.

As Mao had feared, the Chinese DNA had reasserted itself. Confronting the new challenges of the twenty-first century, and in a world where Leninism had collapsed, Hu and Wen turned to traditional wisdom. They described their reform aspirations not in terms of the utopian visions of Mao’s continuous revolution, but by the goal of building a “xiaokang” (“moderately well-off”) society—a term with distinctly Confucian connotations.3 They oversaw a revival of the study of Confucius in Chinese schools and a celebration of his legacy in popular culture. And they enlisted Confucius as a source of Chinese soft power on the world stage—in the official “Confucius Institutes” established in cities worldwide, and in the 2008 Beijing Olympics opening ceremony, which featured a contingent of traditional Confucian scholars. In a dramatic symbolic move, in January 2011, China marked the rehabilitation of the ancient moral philosopher by installing a statue of Confucius at the center of the Chinese capital, Tiananmen Square, within sight of Mao’s mausoleum—the only other personality so honored.4

Two widely read Chinese books symbolize that trend: an essay collection titled China Is Unhappy: The Great Era, the Grand Goal, and Our Internal Anxieties and External Challenges (2009), and China Dream: Great Power Thinking and Strategic Posture in the Post-American Era (2010). Both books are deeply nationalistic. Both start from the assumption that the West is much weaker than previously thought, but that “some foreigners have not yet woken up; they have not truly understood that a power shift is taking place in Sino-Western relations.”15 In this view, it is thus up to China to shake off its self-doubt and passivity, abandon gradualism, and recover its historic sense of mission by means of a “grand goal.” Both books have been criticized in the Chinese press and in anonymous postings on Chinese websites as irresponsible and not reflecting the views of the great majority of Chinese. But both books made it past governmental review and became best-sellers in China, so they presumably reflect the views of at least some portion of China’s institutional structure. This is particularly true in the case of China Dream, written by Liu Mingfu, a PLA Senior Colonel and professor at China’s National Defense University. The books are presented here not because they represent official Chinese government policy—indeed, they are contrary to what President Hu has strongly affirmed in his U.N. address and during his January 2011 state visit in Washington—but because they crystallize certain impulses to which the Chinese government has felt itself obliged to respond.

“The density of soot would reduce global temperatures by roughly 27 degrees Fahrenheit,” climatologist Alan Robock explains. “In America, it would be more like a drop of 40 degrees Fahrenheit, slightly less near the oceans.” The Earth plunges into a new horror called nuclear winter.

And now, decades later, state-of-the-art modeling systems show atmospheric trauma from nuclear winter will, in fact, be even more severe. “Our first models [in 1983] said nuclear winter would last about one year,” Toon explains. “New data suggests the Earth’s recovery time would be more like ten years.” That the sun’s warming rays will reduce by roughly 70 percent.

So what is it? Instead of focusing on rules, Taking Children Seriously focuses on fostering understanding. Parenting is the process of supporting a child until they understand the world well enough that they can support themselves. What is the best way to foster understanding? To provide freedom and security for a person’s creativity to discover how the world works. Rules limit freedom, and hence understanding, and therefore impair the parenting project.

There is nothing wrong with exposing a child to your preferences. Quite the opposite. The key is allowing them to reject your preferences. If they aren’t allowed to opt out, then your preference necessarily disrupts their understanding of the world. If vegetables are unwanted, then being forced to eat them would cause resentment toward the person doing the forcing. Vegetables wouldn’t only be about their taste and texture and how they make the kid feel, but they’d also be about the person who forced it and guesses about that person’s expectations and anxieties. Forcing always introduces confusion, extra layers of problems to solve, or both. Hardly a recipe for learning about food or anything else.

As I began my fellowship, I happened upon some academic literature analyzing the value of history textbooks, especially those used in primary and secondary education, for helping to understand how a nation sees its place in the world.  I initially focused on these sources.  I learned that since the late nineteenth century, nations from Asia to Europe have relied upon history textbooks to help communicate and inculcate successive generations of citizens into particular national narratives, defined here as “stories about a nation's origin and achievements as well as the perceived characteristics of a national community.”  These narratives perform a critical function, helping to “make sense of past events and creating cohesion in the present with a view to the future.”[61]  Because these books are meant for children, the language is usually straightforward and the content lacks the complex argumentation and nuance found in academic writing, which makes it much easier for a newcomer to understand.  It’s illuminating to examine what events authors choose to include in these broad chronologies and, perhaps even more telling, what events they opt to leave out.  Studying these texts can offer an appreciation of the preferred values, norms, behavior, and ideologies which are prized by the nation and which it chooses to instill in its future generations.  These educational texts also tend to reflect how the nation sees itself, its historical ambitions and its grievances.

An even clearer picture of how a nation perceives itself and its place in the world is available by examining visual representations of history such as monuments, art, or exhibits in museums.  Here again, these representations are generally presented in a simplified manner to appeal to a broad audience, so what you see is “all there is.”  More importantly, however, they offer insight into the shared historical experiences that a nation chooses to emphasize as well as those it chooses to forget.

When you do, consider some of the following questions: what events are emphasized and deemphasized?  Battles, political or judicial victories, sporting events? How does the nation portray itself?  As a defender of a particular ideal or value?  What types of heroes are held up as examples?  Military, civilian, religious?  What specific characteristics of these heroes are highlighted?  Answers to all of these questions can help the outsider understand what motivates the nation and determine what its citizens hold sacred.

A second type of source that I found especially useful for learning about a country’s strategic culture are the speeches and writings of popular politicians, military leaders, or other public figures of high regard.  Similar to monuments and museum exhibits, these sources offer insight into the values, norms and behaviors a society deems admirable.  Of particular value are those speeches and commentaries that national leaders traditionally make during commemorative celebrations such as Independence Day, birthdays of national heroes or celebrations of noteworthy military victories or defeats.  As historian Barnet Baskerville noted, the purpose of commemorative speeches is “essentially to intensify and give felicitous expression to feelings already held, rather than to advance new arguments, change opinions, or solve problems.”[63]  They form part of what anthropologist Robert Redfield called the “social organization of tradition,” which is a critical part of building and maintaining the networks of relationships among groups that coalesce into a larger community such as a nation.[64]  Reading these essays and speeches can help to identify the themes that resonate with the population of the nation or region, regardless of political party, religious group, or economic class.

Diplomacy, according to the U.S. Department of State Diplomatic Dictionary, is defined as: “The art and practice of conducting negotiations and maintaining relations between nations; skill in handling affairs without arousing hostility.” It follows that a diplomatic mindset is the established set of attitudes held by someone who has a sensitivity in dealing with others and the ability to achieve peaceful resolutions or facilitate discussion. In addition to professional and technical skills, such as foreign language proficiency, a diplomatic mindset includes people skills or competencies such as empathy and personality that create positive and productive interactions. Sustaining a diplomatic mindset is an iterative process; one of continual practice and evaluation.

The ETO was called an organization of spiritual nobles. Most members came from the highly educated classes, and many were elites of the political and financial spheres. The ETO had once tried to develop membership among the common people, but these efforts all failed. The ETO concluded that the common people did not seem to have the comprehensive and deep understanding of the highly educated about the dark side of humanity. More importantly, because their thoughts were not as deeply influenced by modern science and philosophy, they still felt an overwhelming, instinctual identification with their own species. To betray the human race as a whole was unimaginable for them. But intellectual elites were different: Most of them had already begun to consider issues from a perspective outside the human race. Human civilization had finally given birth to a strong force of alienation.

The science consul said, “The plan focuses on emphasizing the negative environmental effects of scientific development and showing signs of supernatural power to the population of Earth. In addition to highlighting the negative effects of progress, we’ll also attempt to use a series of ‘miracles’ to construct an illusory universe that cannot be explained by the logic of science. After these illusions have been maintained for some time, it’s possible that Trisolaran civilization may become a target of religious worship there. Then, unscientific ways of thinking will dominate scientific thinking among human intellectuals, and lead to the collapse of the entire scientific system of thought.”

As a science fiction writer who began as a fan, I do not use my fiction as a disguised way to criticize the reality of the present. I feel that the greatest appeal of science fiction is the creation of numerous imaginary worlds outside of reality. I’ve always felt that the greatest and most beautiful stories in the history of humanity were not sung by wandering bards or written by playwrights and novelists, but told by science. The stories of science are far more magnificent, grand, involved, profound, thrilling, strange, terrifying, mysterious, and even emotional, compared to the stories told by literature. Only, these wonderful stories are locked in cold equations that most do not know how to read.

What those people valued was high wages ; it didn’t seem to be a matter of any consequence to them whether the high wages would buy anything or not. They stood for “protection,” and swore by it, which was reasonable enough, because interested parties had gulled them into the notion that it was protection which had created their high wages. I proved to them that in a quarter of a century their wages had advanced but 30 per cent., while the cost of living had gone up 100; and that with us, in a shorter time, wages had advanced 40 per cent. while the cost of living had gone steadily down. But it didn’t do any good. Nothing could unseat their strange beliefs.

The old saying that “time is money” is wrong; time is much more fungible and can be spent on many more valuable activities, including the ability to earn more money down the line. The tendency to be cheap with money comes from a belief that money ranks above everything else that can be of value to you. I hope that something you get from reading this is that value takes many forms, and money is not the best expression of value by a long shot. In fact, time is the only true finite resource we have and, therefore, a much better expression of value than money.

The myth of overnight success is one of the most harmful perceptions in business, health, and personal growth. To the person just starting out, it causes them to downplay hardship and overvalue luck. To those who feel stagnant when they are in the middle of a long and challenging road, it makes them feel as if they have missed something or don’t have what it takes, when all they really need to do is keep going. It gives credibility to the excuses that derail progress, and it ignores the daily work and the effort that goes into every success story. The overnight success story is the opposite of the mindset and work that makes progress possible: the voluntary hardship of success.

In the early days of your business, you are going to make sales, run the cash register, clean the floors, stock the shelves, set prices, market, post on social media, and do everything else that goes into running and growing a successful business. Instead of doing that forever, you write a checklist for each job that you do. When you’ve cleaned the bathroom for six months, you ought to know how to do it pretty well. You’ll have figured out how to eliminate minor inefficiencies—how not to mop yourself into a corner and when is the best time to clean. You’re going to have a system for cleaning the bathroom. You write down every part of that system and update it as you find better ways of doing things. Then, when you can, you hire someone to do that job, and you hand them the checklist. You give it to them. It’s theirs to use and update from now on. That way, an SOP lets you transfer your technical expertise to someone else, and for that job, you become a manager.

But in the past decade, and especially in the past few years, a disparate congregation of economists, educators, psychologists, and neuroscientists have begun to produce evidence that calls into question many of the assumptions behind the cognitive hypothesis. What matters most in a child’s development, they say, is not how much information we can stuff into her brain in the first few years. What matters, instead, is whether we are able to help her develop a very different set of qualities, a list that includes persistence, self-control, curiosity, conscientiousness, grit, and self-confidence. Economists refer to these as noncognitive skills, psychologists call them personality traits, and the rest of us sometimes think of them as character.

The behavior outcomes, though surprising in their intensity, at least made some intuitive sense. Psychologists had long believed that traumatic events in childhood could produce feelings of low self-esteem or worthlessness, and it was reasonable to assume that those feelings could lead to addiction, depression, and even suicide. And some of the health effects that turned up in the ACE study, like liver disease and diabetes and lung cancer, were most likely the result, at least in part, of self-destructive behaviors like heavy drinking, overeating, and smoking. But Felitti and Anda found that ACEs had a profound negative effect on adult health even when those behaviors weren’t present. When they looked at patients with high ACE scores (7 or more) who didn’t smoke, didn’t drink to excess, and weren’t overweight, they found that their risk of ischemic heart disease (the single most common cause of death in the United States) was still 360 percent higher than those with an ACE score of 0. The adversity these patients had experienced in childhood was making them sick through a pathway that had nothing to do with behavior.

The part of the brain most affected by early stress is the prefrontal cortex, which is critical in self-regulatory activities of all kinds, both emotional and cognitive. As a result, children who grow up in stressful environments generally find it harder to concentrate, harder to sit still, harder to rebound from disappointments, and harder to follow directions. And that has a direct effect on their performance in school. When you’re overwhelmed by uncontrollable impulses and distracted by negative feelings, it’s hard to learn the alphabet. And in fact, when kindergarten teachers are surveyed about their students, they say that the biggest problem they face is not children who don’t know their letters and numbers; it is kids who don’t know how to manage their tempers or calm themselves down after a provocation. In one national survey, 46 percent of kindergarten teachers said that at least half the kids in their class had problems following directions. In another study, Head Start teachers reported that more than a quarter of their students exhibited serious self-control-related negative behaviors, such as kicking or threatening other students, at least once a week.

One famous test of executive-function ability is called the Stroop test. You see the word red written in green letters, and someone asks you what color that word is. It takes some effort to stop yourself from saying red, and the skills you’re drawing on when you resist that impulse are executive functions. And those skills are especially valuable in school. We’re constantly asking kids to deal with contradictory information. The letter C is pronounced like a K—unless it is pronounced like an S. Tale and tail sound the same but have different meanings. A zero means one thing on its own and an entirely different thing with a one in front of it. Keeping track of those various tricks and exceptions requires a certain amount of cognitive impulse control, and that is a skill that is neurologically related to emotional impulse control—your ability to refrain from punching the kid who just grabbed your favorite toy car.

The reason that researchers who care about the gap between rich and poor are so excited about executive functions is that these skills are not only highly predictive of success; they are also quite malleable, much more so than other cognitive skills. The prefrontal cortex is more responsive to intervention than other parts of the brain, and it stays flexible well into adolescence and early adulthood. So if we can improve a child’s environment in the specific ways that lead to better executive functioning, we can increase his prospects for success in a particularly efficient way.

Laurence Steinberg, a psychologist at Temple University, has analyzed two separate neurological systems that develop in childhood and early adulthood that together have a profound effect on the lives of adolescents. The problem is, these two systems are not well aligned. The first, called the incentive processing system, makes you more sensation seeking, more emotionally reactive, more attentive to social information. (If you’ve ever been a teenager, this may sound familiar.) The second, called the cognitive control system, allows you to regulate all those urges. The reason the teenage years have always been such a perilous time, Steinberg says, is that the incentive processing system reaches its full power in early adolescence while the cognitive control system doesn’t finish maturing until you’re in your twenties.

Parents and other caregivers who are able to form close, nurturing relationships with their children can foster resilience in them that protects them from many of the worst effects of a harsh early environment. This message can sound a bit warm and fuzzy, but it is rooted in cold, hard science. The effect of good parenting is not just emotional or psychological, the neuroscientists say; it is biochemical.

Whatever permutation they chose, though, however they performed the experiment, they found the same thing: what mattered was not the licking-and-grooming habits of the biological mother; it was the licking-and-grooming habits of the rearing mother. When a pup received the comforting experience of licking and grooming as an infant, it grew up to be braver and bolder and better adjusted than a pup who hadn’t, whether or not its biological mother was the one who had done the licking and grooming.

In a series of studies in the 1960s and early 1970s, Ainsworth showed that the effect of early nurturance was exactly the opposite of what the behaviorists expected. Babies whose parents responded readily and fully to their cries in the first months of life were, at one year, more independent and intrepid than babies whose parents had ignored their cries. In preschool, the pattern continued—the children whose parents had responded most sensitively to their emotional needs as infants were the most self-reliant.

Most children greeted the returning mother happily, running to her and reconnecting with her, sometimes tearfully, sometimes with joy. These children Ainsworth labeled securely attached, and in subsequent experiments over the past few decades, psychologists have come to believe that they make up about 60 percent of American children. Children who did not have a warm reunion—pretending to ignore the mother when she returned; lashing out at her; falling to the floor in a heap—were labeled anxiously attached. Ainsworth found that a child’s reaction in the Strange Situation was directly related to his parents’ degree of responsiveness in that first year of life. Parents who were attuned to their child’s mood and responsive to his cues produced securely attached children; parenting that was detached or conflicted or hostile produced anxiously attached children. And early attachment, Ainsworth said, created psychological effects that could last a lifetime.

But when it came to teaching character, Levin told me, he and Feinberg found no equivalent mentor. The absence of any established structure for teaching character, or even talking about it, meant that each year, the discussions at KIPP schools would start from scratch, with teachers and administrators debating anew which values and behaviors they were trying to nurture in their students, and why, and how.

Learned Optimism, a book by Martin Seligman, a professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. Seligman is one of the main scholars behind the school of thought known as positive psychology, and the book, originally published in 1991, is the movement’s founding text, teaching that optimism is a learnable skill, not an inborn trait. Pessimistic adults and children can train themselves to be more hopeful, Seligman says, and if they do, they will likely become happier, healthier, and more successful. In Learned Optimism, Seligman wrote that for most people, depression was not an illness, as most psychologists believed, but simply a “severe low mood” that occurred “when we harbor pessimistic beliefs about the causes of our setbacks.” If you want to avoid depression and improve your life, Seligman counseled, you need to refashion your “explanatory style,” to create for yourself a better story about why good and bad things happen to you.

Pessimists, Seligman wrote, tend to react to negative events by explaining them as permanent, personal, and pervasive. (Seligman calls these “the three P’s.”) Failed a test? It’s not because you didn’t prepare well; it’s because you’re stupid. If you get turned down for a date, there’s no point in asking someone else; you’re simply unlovable. Optimists, by contrast, look for specific, limited, short-term explanations for bad events, and as a result, in the face of a setback, they’re more likely to pick themselves up and try again.

Levin and Randolph each came to Philadelphia expecting to talk about optimism. But Seligman surprised them by pulling out a new and very different book, which he and Peterson had just finished: Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification. The bestselling books that Seligman had published previously were relatively thin works of popularly accessible psychology with subtitles designed to catch the eye in an airport bookstore (“How to Change Your Mind and Your Life”!), but Character Strengths and Virtues was an eight-hundred-page scholarly tome that weighed in at three and a half pounds and retailed for eighty dollars. It was intended, according to the authors, to be a “manual of the sanities,” a mirror image of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or the DSM, the authoritative taxonomy of psychiatric maladies that sat on the bookshelf of every therapist and psychiatrist. Character Strengths and Virtues was an attempt to inaugurate a “science of good character.” It was, in other words, exactly what Randolph and Levin had each been looking for, even if neither of them had quite known it.

But before long, the Clintons’ character campaign devolved into finger-pointing and mutual suspicion between advocates on both ends of the political spectrum; the right suspected that character-education initiatives were a cloak for creeping political correctness, and the left suspected the initiatives were hidden attempts at Christian indoctrination. Hundreds of American public schools now have some kind of character-education program in place, but most of them are vague and superficial, and those that have been studied rigorously have generally been found to be ineffective. A national evaluation of character-education programs published in 2010 by the National Center for Education Research, part of the federal Department of Education, studied seven popular elementary-school programs over three consecutive years. It found no significant impact at all from the programs—not on student behavior, not on academic achievement, not on school culture.

The problem with self-control techniques like the ones that the most disciplined marshmallow resisters employed is that they work only when a child knows what he or she wants. The long-term goals Duckworth hoped kids would aspire to were less tangible and immediate and attractive than two marshmallows after twenty minutes. So how do you help children acquire the focus and persistence they will need for longer-term, more abstract goals: passing a test or graduating from high school or succeeding in college?

The medium-IQ and high-IQ kids who got candy didn’t improve their scores at all on the second test. But the low-IQ children who were given M&M’s for each correct answer raised their IQ scores to about 97, almost erasing the gap with the medium-IQ group. The M&M studies were a major blow to the conventional wisdom about intelligence, which held that IQ tests measured something real and permanent—something that couldn’t be changed drastically with a few candy-covered chocolates. They also raised an important and puzzling question about the supposedly low-IQ children: Did they actually have low IQs or not? Which number was the true measure of their intelligence: 79 or 97?

That was their equivalent of the coding-test score, the low-stakes, low-reward test that predicts how well someone is going to do in life. They may not have been low in IQ, but they were low in whatever quality it is that makes a person try hard on an IQ test without any obvious incentive.

Like the word character, the word conscientiousness has some strong and not always positive associations outside academia. “Researchers prefer to study the things they value,” he told me. “And the people in society who value conscientiousness are not intellectuals, and they’re not academics, and they’re not liberals. They tend to be religious-right conservatives who think people should be more controlled.”

In fact, the character-strength approach of Seligman and Peterson isn’t an expansion of programs like CARE; if anything, it is a repudiation of them. In 2008, a national organization called the Character Education Partnership published a paper that divided character education into two categories: programs that develop “moral character,” which embodies ethical values like fairness, generosity, and integrity; and those that address “performance character,” which includes values like effort, diligence, and perseverance. The CARE program falls firmly on the “moral character” side of the divide, but the seven strengths that Randolph and Levin chose for their schools leaned much more heavily toward performance character: while they do have a moral component, strengths like zest, optimism, social intelligence, and curiosity aren’t particularly heroic; they make you think of Steve Jobs or Bill Clinton more than Martin Luther King Jr. or Gandhi.

And so she undertook a study comparing more than two hundred mostly white, mostly wealthy suburban tenth-graders with a similar number of mostly African American, low-income urban tenth-grade students. To Luthar’s surprise, she found the affluent teenagers used alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and harder illegal drugs more than the low-income teens. Thirty-five percent of the suburban girls had tried all four substances, compared with just 15 percent of the inner-city girls.

The problem, as Randolph has realized, is that the best way for a young person to build character is for him to attempt something where there is a real and serious possibility of failure. In a high-risk endeavor, whether it’s in business or athletics or the arts, you are more likely to experience colossal defeat than in a low-risk one—but you’re also more likely to achieve real and original success. “The idea of building grit and building self-control is that you get that through failure,” Randolph explained. “And in most highly academic environments in the United States, no one fails anything.”

The intervention, which goes by the rather clunky name of Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intentions, or MCII, was developed by NYU psychologist Gabriele Oettingen and her colleagues. Oettingen discovered in her research that people tend to use three strategies when they are setting goals and that two of those strategies don’t work very well. Optimists favor indulging, which means imagining the future they’d like to achieve (for a middle-school student, that might mean getting an A in math next year) and vividly envisioning all the good things that will go along with it—the praise, the self-satisfaction, the future success. Oettingen found that indulging feels really good when you’re doing it—it can trigger a nice dopamine surge—but it doesn’t correlate at all with actual achievement. Pessimists tend to use a strategy Oettingen calls dwelling, which involves thinking about all the things that will get in the way of their accomplishing their goals. If our prototypical middle-school student hoping for an A in math was a dweller, he might think about how he never finishes his homework, and there’s never anywhere quiet for him to study anyway, and besides, he always gets distracted in class. Unsurprisingly, dwelling doesn’t correlate well with achievement either. The third method is called mental contrasting, and it combines elements of the other two methods. It means concentrating on a positive outcome and simultaneously concentrating on the obstacles in the way. Doing both at the same time, Duckworth and Oettingen wrote in a recent paper, “creates a strong association between future and reality that signals the need to overcome the obstacles in order to attain the desired future.” The next step to a successful outcome, according to Oettingen, is creating a series of “implementation intentions”—specific plans in the form of if/then statements that link the obstacles with ways to overcome them, such as “If I get distracted by TV after school, then I will wait to watch TV until after I finish my homework.” Oettingen has demonstrated the effectiveness of MCII in a variety of experiments: the strategy has helped dieters eat more fruits and vegetables, high-school juniors prepare more diligently for the practice SAT, and chronic-back-pain patients gain more mobility.

Rules, Kessler points out, are not the same as willpower. They are a metacognitive substitute for willpower. By making yourself a rule (“I never eat fried dumplings”), you can sidestep the painful internal conflict between your desire for fried foods and your willful determination to resist them. Rules, Kessler explains, “provide structure, preparing us for encounters with tempting stimuli and redirecting our attention elsewhere.” Before long, the rules have become as automatic as the appetites they are deflecting.

But a psychologist at Stanford named Carol Dweck has discovered a remarkable thing: Regardless of the facts on the malleability of intelligence, students do much better academically if they believe intelligence is malleable. Dweck divides people into two types: those who have a fixed mindset, who believe that intelligence and other skills are essentially static and inborn, and those who have a growth mindset, who believe that intelligence can be improved. She has shown that students’ mindsets predict their academic trajectories: those who believe that people can improve their intelligence actually do improve their grades. And whether or not intelligence is malleable, mindset certainly is. Dweck and others have shown that with the right kind of intervention, students can be switched from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset, and their academic results tend to rise as a result.

It’s a little like what people ideally get out of psychotherapy, Spiegel says. You go over the mistakes you made—or the mistakes you keep making—and you try to get to the bottom of why you made them. And just like the best therapists, Spiegel tries to lead her students down a narrow and difficult path: to have them take responsibility for their mistakes and learn from them without obsessing over them or beating themselves up for them. “Very rarely do kids have an experience in life of losing when it was entirely in their control,” she told me. “But when they lose a chess game, they know that they have no one to blame but themselves. They had everything they needed to win, and they lost. If that happens to you once, you can usually find some excuse, or just never think about it again. When it’s part of your life, when it happens to you every single weekend, you have to find a way to separate yourself from your mistakes or your losses. I try to teach my students that losing is something you do, not something you are.”

In the early twentieth century, the Austrian philosopher Sir Karl Popper wrote that the nature of scientific thought was such that one could never truly verify scientific theories; the only way to test the validity of any particular theory was to prove it wrong, a process he labeled falsification. This idea made its way into cognitive science with the observation that most people are actually quite bad at falsification—not just in science but in daily life. When testing a theory, however large or small, an individual doesn’t instinctively look for evidence that contradicts it; he looks for data that prove him right, a tendency known as confirmation bias. That tendency and the ability to overcome it turn out to be crucial elements in chess success.

If the house is bustling, with people working or making noise, then I’ll often get a study room at the local library. When I’m traveling, I make use of an airport lounge. Most airports will let you buy a one-day pass, and it will have everything you need to set up a quiet workspace. Then, of course, you can get a lot of work done on the airplane, where you are essentially forced to sit quietly without notifications or the expectation that you will be available for an extended time. I always pay for Wi-Fi and use flights to do focused work while thirty thousand feet in the air. I’ve heard stories of authors who purchase tickets over and over, crossing the country and writing their books exclusively on airplanes where there are no distractions.

Your workspace is one way to get around this kind of work avoidance. Our bodies and minds respond to intentionality. By creating an intentional space, even a temporary one, you learn to signal to yourself that it’s time to focus. It is like the martial artists who bow before stepping onto the mat or into the ring. They acknowledge a very real threshold: On one side is the world and its distractions. On the other is a space dedicated to a single purpose. Your workspace does not have to be the same space every day, but in creating it for the sole purpose of focused work, you acknowledge that singularity of purpose. It is one of the best things you can do for improved productivity.

The Pomodoro Technique uses a simple pattern for shifting into and maintaining focused work. The technique is simple: work for twenty-five undistracted minutes. Take a five-minute break. Repeat as necessary. The technique relies on the mind’s relatively quick recovery time between intense bouts of work, helping you maximize sustainable focus while minimizing diminishing returns due to a loss of attention and mental fatigue.

The break is for taking care of distractions and preparing for the next work interval. So, use the bathroom, answer texts, and fill up your coffee, but don’t use the break to create more distractions. It’s tempting to reward yourself for completing tasks with longer breaks or highly distracting activities like scrolling social media or starting conversations. The break is just a break. Anything else is guaranteed to pull you out of the focused, flow state of work that you spent so much energy building. It’s also tempting to keep working past the twenty-five-minute mark when you are on a roll. Occasionally, I will let myself work a few extra minutes during that flow state, but it’s perfectly fine to stop mid-thought or mid-sentence when the timer goes off. The five-minute break will not pull you out of your flow, but when you start back up, you will know exactly where to start, reducing the natural hesitancies in starting and stopping work.

Parkinson’s Law is a powerful force, but we can leverage it to our advantage. If work expands to fill the time you give it, simply give it less time. Parkinson himself wrote, “It is the busiest man who has time to spare.” For every important task, create a deadline for completion. Without a deadline, you are just “doing your best” to finish things in a reasonable amount of time. Every job will take much longer than necessary. Deadlines add some time pressure to your tasks. Aggressive deadlines will compress those tasks down to their actual size rather than letting them linger and take up more of your day than is strictly necessary.

The United States and China can likewise avoid war, but only if they can internalize two difficult truths. First, on the current trajectory, war between the US and China in the decades ahead is not just possible, but much more likely than currently recognized. Indeed, on the historical record, war is more likely than not. By underestimating the danger, moreover, we add to the risk.

Lee Kuan Yew was, of course, no CIA spy. His mind, heart, and soul belonged to Singapore. But the longtime statesman, who died in 2015, was a font of wisdom hiding in plain sight. The report I gave to David was a sneak preview of Lee Kuan Yew: The Grand Master’s Insights on China, the United States, and the World, a book that I coauthored in 2013 with Robert Blackwill and Ali Wyne. As the founder and long-serving leader of that tiny city-state, Lee took a small, poor, inconsequential fishing village and raised it to become a modern megalopolis. Ethnically Chinese, he was educated at Cambridge University and embodied a fusion of Confucian and upper-class English values. And until his death in 2015, he was also unquestionably the world’s premier China watcher.

His 2016 book, The Pivot: The Future of American Statecraft in Asia, makes the best possible case for the “great rebalance” as more than aspiration. Despite his best efforts, however, he is unable to find many metrics to support his thesis. Measured in attention span of the president, time spent at National Security Council principals’ and deputies’ meetings, face time with leaders of the region, sorties flown, hours of ships on station, and dollars allocated, the pivot is hard to find. Ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan combined with new wars in Syria and against ISIS across the Middle East to monopolize the administration’s foreign policy agenda and dominate the president’s days over his eight years in office. As one Obama White House official recalled: “It never felt like we pivoted away from the Middle East.

In response to these trends, many Americans have sought refuge in the belief that for all its size and bluster, China’s success is still essentially a story of imitation and mass production. This view has some grounding in reality: theft of intellectual property—both in the old-fashioned way, with spies, and increasingly by exploiting cyber methods as well—has been another key part of China’s economic development program. As a Chinese colleague once explained to me, what Americans call R&D (research and development), Chinese think of as RD&T, where the T stands for theft. Of course, China only targets nations that have intellectual property worth stealing—the most important being the United States. “The amount of theft that’s going on is simply staggering,” FBI director James Comey said in 2014. “There’s only two types of big corporations in America. Those who have been hacked by the Chinese, or those who don’t yet know they’ve been hacked by the Chinese.” A 2016 investigation by CBS’s 60 Minutes reported that China’s corporate espionage has cost American companies hundreds of billions of dollars, leading a top Justice Department official to call Chinese cybertheft “a serious threat to our national security.”58

But the history of international relations in the years since offer clues. When states repeatedly fail to act in what appears to be their true national interest, it is often because their policies reflect necessary compromises among parties within their government rather than a single coherent vision.

In the decade that followed his arrival in Washington, the US declared war on Spain, expelling it from the Western Hemisphere and acquiring Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines; threatened Germany and Britain with war unless they agreed to settle disputes on American terms; supported an insurrection in Colombia to create a new country, Panama, in order to build a canal; and declared itself the policeman of the Western Hemisphere, asserting the right to intervene whenever and wherever it judged necessary—a right it exercised nine times in the seven years of TR’s presidency alone.4

Roosevelt had no patience for those who opposed his agenda. In his view, “Every expansion of civilization makes for peace . . . Every expansion of a great civilized power means a victory for law, order, and righteousness.”14 Even when acknowledging that the United States acted in self-interest, TR insisted that expanding US influence would improve the lives of those not yet capable of governing themselves. His justification for the American occupation of the Philippines typifies what the historian Albert Weinberg wryly referred to as a “virile conception of international altruism.” TR called on his countrymen to recognize “our duty toward the people living in barbarism to see that they are freed from their chains,” and that “we can free them only by destroying barbarism itself.” In words that would have made Rudyard Kipling and Cecil Rhodes smile, TR argued, “The missionary, the merchant, and the soldier may each have a part to play in this destruction, and in the consequent uplifting of the people.”15 Today, many Americans find these words uncomfortable, imperialist, or racist—though one can hear echoes in twenty-first-century claims about American leadership in upholding an international rules-based liberal order. Like most Americans of his time, Roosevelt believed that the advance of civilization was “fraught with lasting benefits” for all societies, since “the best that can happen to any people that has not already a high civilization of its own is to assimilate and profit by American or European ideas.”16 What he called “our share of the world’s work” obliged the US to follow in the footsteps of England, France, and Germany in spreading “the ideas of civilization and Christianity.”17 As he promised in his first State of the Union address, the US would “do for [Filipinos] what has never before been done for any people of the tropics—make them fit for self-government after the fashion of the really free nations.”18

After his official inquiry concluded that a mine had caused the explosion, McKinley had no choice but to declare war.32 TR immediately resigned from his position as assistant secretary, secured a commission as a lieutenant colonel in the US Army, and organized the First US Volunteer Cavalry Regiment—the Rough Riders. TR and his Riders became legend during the Battle of San Juan, helping capture San Juan Hill in a chaotic firefight on July 1, 1898. In the thick of battle, TR demonstrated the manly courage about which he had written. A fellow soldier marveled at the way he “moved about in the midst of the shrapnel explosions . . . Theodore preferred to stand up or walk about sniffing the fragrant air of combat.” Roosevelt later recalled the battle as the greatest day of his life.33

At first, Roosevelt relied on an imaginative reading of an 1846 US-Colombia treaty to argue that, in effect, America already had permission to build the canal. “I feel we are certainly justified in morals,” Roosevelt confided to a US Senate ally, “and therefore justified in law, under the treaty of 1846, in interfering summarily and saying that the canal is to be built and that they must not stop it.”55 But when the French engineer and businessman Philippe Bunau-Varilla brought news that a revolution was brewing in Panama, TR switched horses.

On November 3, the rebels issued their declaration of independence. A contingent of marines landed and shut the main railway to prevent the Colombian military from reaching Panama City, while the US ships blocked the Colombians from landing naval reinforcements. TR also warned the Colombian government that if it tried to oppose Panamanian independence, it should expect to see American forces on its territory. Less than seventy-two hours after the Panamanian rebels declared independence, the US was the first to recognize the new nation and establish diplomatic relations.59

London bowed under the pressure. In October 1903, the tribunal rendered its 4–2 decision, giving the United States a sweeping victory on all claims. Alverstone had cast the critical vote. The two Canadian commissioners refused to sign the final ruling, protesting that they were “powerless to prevent” the machinations of the US and Britain. In Canada, the verdict “set off one of the most concentrated explosions of resentment” in the country’s history, according to Canadian historian Norman Penlington. The press claimed that Canada had been “sacrificed,” “tricked,” and “robbed,” deriding Alverstone for selling out Canada to satisfy the insatiable American president.73 The Washington Morning Post, on the other hand, reported that Roosevelt and his administration “regard the award as far and away the greatest diplomatic success which the United States have gained for a generation.”74 In exchange for a few minor concessions to Canada, the US maintained an unbroken coastal strip: twenty-five thousand square miles of coast and islands along the Alaskan panhandle and a swath of the pristine Tsongas wilderness that would become America’s largest national forest. When all was said and done, the land TR won from territory claimed by Canada added roughly another Rhode Island to American territory.75

After leaving office, TR told a friend: “If I must choose between a policy of blood and iron and one of milk and water, I am for the policy of blood and iron. It is better not only for the nation but in the long run for the world.”77 Yet the impact of TR’s “civilizing mission” and “police power” rankled many in the hemisphere.78 In 1913, the Argentine political leader Manuel Ugarte spoke plainly to the newly elected Woodrow Wilson, noting that many Latin American countries “have become open season for the vilest of instincts that in the United States itself are not condoned since they violate notions of public responsibility and opinion . . . As a result of such behavior the United States has gradually become the most unpopular nation among us.” Díaz had famously captured this sentiment with his lament, “Poor Mexico!

LEADERSHIP PREPARATION Now that we have examined some of the basics of Air Force leadership, here is how you can best prepare yourself to lead: Think about Leadership. What would you do in a given situation, and why? If leadership placed you in charge of your work unit tomorrow, how would you act? Remember the concepts, traits, and principles of Air Force leadership. Observe Leaders in Action. How does your boss handle a given situation? Why did a particular action succeed or fail? How do your wing commander, squadron commander, first sergeant, and supervisor lead? Study Leadership and the Profession of Arms. The military has a long tradition of leadership. Read about the successful leaders in our history and how they led. Alfred Thayer Mahan wrote, “The study of history lies at the foundation of all sound military conclusions and practice.” You must have detailed professional knowledge to develop perspective and to meet the challenges of the future. Practice Leadership. Look for opportunities to exercise leadership. It can be as simple as taking the initiative and leading one person to complete a task. Learn from your efforts, seek feedback, and evaluate your efforts. Always lead by positive example. Do not confuse leadership with management. Leadership is about people; management is about things.

Do Not Hasten to Change Things. Sometimes officers assuming command of an Air Force unit are overly quick to disrupt standing operating procedures (SOPs), to radically modify policies the unit personnel have become familiar with, and generally to create confusion. As the new commander, you should allow a reasonable period of time to study the organization, the personnel, and the practices that preceded your command before launching into major changes.

To a greater degree than commanders at higher levels, squadron commanders must be in intimate touch with their people and know their individual characteristics and capacities, their degree of training, their morale, and their discipline. They must provide for the welfare of their people under all conditions. In training, they must prepare their own people to succeed despite the most rigorous hardships. In war or even in training, they must save them from all unnecessary trials to preserve their stamina. The conditions airmen experience in their own squadrons determine their opinions of the Air Force as a whole.

“Making China Great Again” means: Returning China to the predominance in Asia it enjoyed before the West intruded. Reestablishing control over the territories of “greater China,” including not just Xinjiang and Tibet on the mainland, but also Hong Kong and Taiwan. Recovering its historic sphere of influence along its borders and in the adjacent seas so that others give it the deference great nations have always demanded. Commanding the respect of other great powers in the councils of the world. At the core of these national goals is a civilizational creed that sees China as the center of the universe. In the Chinese language, the word for China, zhong guo (中国), means “Middle Kingdom.” “Middle” refers not to the space between other, rival kingdoms, but to all that lies between heaven and earth.

Kissinger had made his career studying and writing about European history, not Asia. Knowing that he needed a crash course, he began with a weekend tutorial from his Harvard colleague John King Fairbank, the founding dean of modern China studies in the United States. In Fairbank’s summary, classical Chinese foreign policy consisted of three key tenets: demand for regional “dominance,” insistence that neighboring countries recognize and respect China’s inherent “superiority,” and willingness to use this dominance and superiority to orchestrate “harmonious co-existence” with its neighbors.10

From Fairbank, Kissinger learned “the disesteem of physical coercion deeply embedded in Confucian teaching.” For China, “the military functioned as a last resort.” Fairbank also explained that China’s concept of international order mirrors its internal governance. In Fairbank’s classic summary, “Chinese tended to think of their foreign relations as giving expression externally to the same principles of social and political order that were manifested internally.” As a result, “China’s foreign relations were accordingly hierarchic and non-egalitarian.”11 Just as it suppressed dissent and demanded that all its citizens bow to the power of the central government, so too did it expect regional powers to prostrate themselves before Beijing.

Instead of suicide, Xi chose to embrace the reality of the jungle. There—in his apt word—he was “reborn.” As one of his longtime friends told an American diplomat, he “chose to survive by becoming redder than red”—and doing whatever it took to claw his way back to the top.22 Xi was nothing if not persistent. The leader of 1.4 billion people and a Communist Party with 89 million members was actually rejected the first nine times he sought to join the Party, succeeding finally on his tenth attempt.

Little did they know. By the end of his second year as president, Xi had so firmly concentrated power in his own hands that he was often referred to as the “Chairman of Everything.” Unlike his go-along to get-along predecessors, he has sidelined other figures so completely that he has no deputy or obvious successor. Though his vice premier, Li Keqiang, continued on paper to lead the economic reform program, decision making on all key issues in fact shifted to a newly created Leading Group for Financial and Economic Affairs, headed by Xi’s trusted colleague Liu He, reporting directly to the president. Wielding a highly visible anticorruption campaign to masterful effect, he purged dozens of powerful rivals previously thought to be untouchable, including the former head of China’s internal security service, Zhou Yongkang—the first Standing Committee member ever prosecuted for corruption. In his consolidation of power, Xi has taken more than a dozen titles for himself, including chairman of a new national security council and commander in chief of the military, a title that even Mao was never given. And he has had himself anointed China’s “Core Leader”—a term symbolic of his centrality to the state that Hu had allowed to lapse. Most significant, as of this writing Xi appears to be setting the stage to defy traditional term limits and remain in power beyond 2022.27*

When Xi Jinping has nightmares, the apparition he sees is Mikhail Gorbachev. Shortly after taking power, Xi asked his close colleagues a rhetorical question: “Why did the Soviet Union collapse?” As he never tires of reminding them, “It is a profound lesson for us.” After careful analysis, Xi concluded that Gorbachev made three fatal errors. He relaxed political control of society before he had reformed his country’s economy. He and his predecessors allowed the Communist Party to become corrupt, and ultimately hollow. And he “nationalized” the Soviet military, requiring commanders to swear allegiance to the nation, not the Party and its leader. As a result, this “left the Party disarmed.” When opponents rose up to overthrow the system, in Xi’s words, there was nobody left who “was man enough to stand up and resist.”36

He has boosted R&D spending, incubated tech start-ups, and called for a “robot revolution.” (In 2016, China employed more robots than any other country.)51 He believes that China’s concentration of power in government gives it inherent advantages over Western competitors because it “can pool resources in a major mission.”52 Unlike the US in recent years, it can also sustain commitments over a decade or longer if required, as it has demonstrated in becoming the leader in fast trains, solar power, supercomputers, and other arenas.

Huntington was keen to disabuse readers of the Western myth of universal values, which he said was not just naive but inimical to other civilizations, particularly the Confucian one with China at its center. “The very notion that there could be a ‘universal civilization’ is a Western idea, directly at odds with the particularism of most Asian societies and their emphasis on what distinguishes one people from another,” he wrote.15 That is, the West believes that a basic set of values and beliefs—including individualism, liberalism, equality, liberty, rule of law, democracy, free markets, and the separation of church and state—should be embraced by all of humanity. To the contrary, Asian cultures prize their unique sets of values and beliefs that distinguish them from other people.

Despite their many differences, the United States and China are alike in at least one respect: both have extreme superiority complexes. Each sees itself as exceptional—literally without peers. While Muhammad Ali’s “I am the greatest” rightly captures American swagger, China’s conception of itself as the unique link between humans and the heavens might be even more immodest. The clash of these two number ones will require painful adjustment. Will it be more difficult for the Chinese to rationalize a cosmology in which there are two “suns,” or for the US to accept that it must live with another, and possibly superior, superpower? Lee Kuan Yew had doubts about America’s ability to adapt to a new reality: “For America to be displaced, not in the world, but only in the western Pacific, by an Asian people long despised and dismissed with contempt as decadent, feeble, corrupt, and inept is emotionally very difficult to accept. The sense of cultural supremacy of the Americans will make this adjustment most difficult.”23

America’s government was conceived as a democratic republic, whereas China’s—under the Qing emperors and Communist Party leaders—might best be characterized as responsive authoritarianism. Competing conceptions of political legitimacy have become a sore point in US-China relations. In Kissinger’s apt summary, “The conviction that American principles are universal has introduced a challenging element into the international system because it implies that governments not practicing them are less than fully legitimate.”36 He goes on to explain how this tenet, which we take for granted, predictably breeds resentment among nations who are made to feel they live in a benighted political system awaiting redemption by American values. Needless to say, this type of righteousness does not go over well in China.

Americans think of themselves as problem solvers. Reflecting their short-termism, they see problems as discrete issues to be addressed and solved now—so that they can move on to the next ones. In Lee Kuan Yew’s words: “When they fail, they pick themselves up and start afresh. The American culture is that we start from scratch and beat you. What kind of mindset do you need for that? It is part of their history. They went into an empty continent and made the best of it.”42 In what has been called the United States of Amnesia, every day is new, every crisis “unprecedented.” This contrasts sharply with the institutional memory of the Chinese, who recognize that there is nothing new under the sun.

Americans urge other powers to accept a “rule-based international order.” But through Chinese eyes, this appears to be an order in which Americans make the rules, and others obey the orders. A former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Martin Dempsey, became familiar with the predictable resentment this elicited from China. “One of the things that fascinated me about the Chinese is whenever I would have a conversation with them about international standards or international rules of behavior, they would inevitably point out that those rules were made when they were absent from the world stage,” Dempsey remarked. “They are no longer absent from the world stage, and so those rules need to be renegotiated with them.”

There are all sorts of dream interpretations, Freud’s being the most notorious, but I have always believed they served a simple eliminatory function, and not much more—that dreams are the psyche’s way of taking a good dump every now and then. And that people who don’t dream—or don’t dream in a way they can often remember when they wake up—are mentally constipated in some way.

War for Chinese strategists is primarily psychological and political; military campaigns are a secondary concern. In Chinese thinking, an opponent’s perception of facts on the ground may be just as important as the facts themselves. Creating and sustaining the image of a civilization so superior that it is the “center of the universe,” for example, deters enemies from challenging Chinese dominance. The sheer size of the Chinese economy relative to those of outsiders also plays a role in subduing them—for instance, through access or denial to trade. If psychological deterrence and economic incentives fail, the barbarians outside China’s borders can be set against one another in a contest in which everyone would lose except China. Eroding the enemy’s material capability and morale, and backing him into an alley from which there is no exit, is far better than defeating him on the battlefield.

Chinese seek victory not in a decisive battle but through incremental moves designed to gradually improve their position. To quote Kissinger again: “Rarely did Chinese statesmen risk the outcome of a conflict on a single all-or-nothing clash: elaborate multi-year maneuvers were closer to their style. Where the Western tradition prized the decisive clash of forces emphasizing feats of heroism, the Chinese ideal stressed subtlety, indirection, and the patient accumulation of relative advantage.”48

As political scientist Taylor Fravel has shown in a study of its twenty-three territorial disputes since 1949, China employed force in only three of them. As these cases suggest, China becomes more likely to resort to force if it believes an adversary is shifting the balance of forces against it at a time of domestic unrest. In his analysis of Beijing’s attacks on India in 1962, the Soviet Union in 1969, and Vietnam in 1979, Fravel also demonstrates that China tends to use its military against opponents of comparable or greater strength, while it is more willing to negotiate with weaker adversaries.53 In sum, as long as developments in the South China Sea are generally moving in China’s favor, it appears unlikely to use military force. But if trends in the correlation of forces should shift against it, particularly at a moment of domestic political instability, China could initiate a limited military conflict, even against a larger, more powerful state like the US. How such a conflict might occur is the focus of the next chapter.

Who emptied the beaker loses importance beside the general truth: At the end of all rationalism, the mass grave. The laws of physics, the laws of biology, the axioms of mathematics, they’re all part of the deathtrip, because we are what we are. If it hadn’t been Captain Trips, it would have been something else. The fashion was to blame it on ‘technology,’ but ‘technology’ is the trunk of the tree, not the roots. The roots are rationalism, and I would define that word so: ‘Rationalism is the idea we can ever understand anything about the state of being.’ It’s a deathtrip. It always has been.

British leaders’ skill in finding ways to satisfy even unreasonable American demands without sacrificing vital British national interests is a textbook example of well-executed diplomacy. By laying the foundation for what historians have called the Great Rapprochement, Britain helped to heal long-standing hostility between the two nations to the point that when war came in 1914, it could count on the US as an essential source of materiel and finance for its war effort. After German submarines began attacking American ships, Washington joined the war alongside London. Had Britain been unable to obtain American loans and supplies, and later American military partnership, Germany might well have triumphed in World War

The United States is the largest market for Chinese exports, and China is America’s largest creditor. If war prevented the US from buying Chinese goods, and China from buying American dollars, the economic and social impact on each would almost certainly outweigh any benefits that war could achieve. Recognizing that Angell made a similar argument before World War I, proponents of MAED have offered two further considerations. Some argue that Angell was right. The costs of war to all parties in World War I did far exceed the benefits the victors reaped. If given the chance to repeat their choices, none would. Since that is now clear, the next time statesmen will be smarter. Others emphasize differences between the earlier case and US-Chinese economic relations today. Levels of trade and investment are similar to those prior to World War I. But supply chains connecting the indispensable producer to the irreplaceable consumer have become so integrated that virtually everything sold in the US, from iPhones to Boeing aircraft, is made with components from China.

Furthermore, the Chinese government has made a “cosmic bet” on an open global marketplace to which it can sell its products and on daily arrivals of tankers delivering oil to power its factories, cars, and planes. All are essential for sustaining the extraordinary rate of economic growth on which the Communist Party’s claim to political legitimacy—indeed, its “mandate of heaven”—depends. Both are vulnerable to interruption by the United States. America is not only the major market for Chinese products. Two-thirds of China’s oil imports travel across oceans where the US Navy is the guardian and ultimate arbiter—a position it will retain long into the future. War between the US and China, therefore, would certainly mean the end of both economies as we now know them.

While the pivot to Asia was one of the Obama administration’s most heralded foreign policy initiatives, in reality it was largely a rhetorical repackaging of the strategy that America has followed toward China under both Republicans and Democrats since the end of the Cold War.8 This strategy is known as “engage but hedge.”9 Its fundamental flaw is that it permits everything and prohibits nothing.

Assessing America’s “engage but hedge” strategy, Lee Kuan Yew identified two fatal flaws. First, China is not about to become a democracy. As he put it bluntly, “If it were to do so, it would collapse.” Second, comparing China to Germany and Japan misses the fact that the latter two were first defeated in a hot war, occupied by American troops, and governed for a period thereafter by American high commanders who even wrote their constitutions. In contrast, in Lee’s words, China will insist on “being accepted as China, not as an honorary member of the West.”12

How should we understand these outcomes? The great Greek playwrights like Sophocles, whose tragedies dominated the literary landscape in ancient Greece, thought fate was the answer. In their drama, the gods scripted Oedipus to kill his father and marry his mother. From his assigned role there was no escape. But Thucydides disagreed. He had a distinctly different concept of human affairs. Indeed, he defined a new discipline of history in which men, not gods, were the chief actors. Destiny dealt the hands, but men played the cards. His history provides a factual record of the choices Pericles and his fellow Athenians made of their own free will. Different choices would have produced different results. Indeed, his purpose in reconstructing the Assembly debate was to teach future statesmen not to accept their fate but to make wiser choices. Athenians did not have to go to war with Sparta in 430 BCE. In fact, almost half the Assembly voted against the alliance that led to war. Could the same Pericles who negotiated the Thirty Years’ Peace not have foreseen the conflict between Corinth and Corcyra and taken action to defuse it before it spiraled into war?

To make similarly wise choices, US leaders will need to muster a combination of hard thinking and harder work. They can begin with four core ideas: Clarify vital interests. Defending America’s vital interests depends first on defining them. To prioritize everything is to prioritize nothing. Yet this is Washington’s natural reflex. In a struggle as epic as the one between China and the United States, American leaders must distinguish the vital from the vivid.3 For example, is maintaining US primacy in the western Pacific truly a vital national interest? Would Americans “bear any burden” to keep China from seizing islands in the South China Sea, or even from reclaiming Taiwan? These are not rhetorical questions. Geopolitical projects—or even responses to crises—decoupled from national priorities are bound to fail. The German philosopher Nietzsche taught us that “the most common form of human stupidity is forgetting what one is trying to do.” In thinking clearly about America’s role in the world, we cannot improve on the wise men’s Cold War imperative. As noted in chapter 9, that means preserving the US “as a free nation with our fundamental institutions and values intact.” That does not require defending every claim made by the Philippines or Vietnam in the South China Sea. It does not even require defending the Philippines. But it does require avoiding nuclear war with China.

Cold war has come to be seen as a no-go option in international relations—something to be avoided at virtually any cost. But a quarter century after the dissolution of the Soviet empire (and at a time of renewed angst between Washington and Moscow), it is worth reflecting on the dependable elements of the old US-Soviet relationship. Pretense invites ambiguity; candor breeds clarity. “We will bury you!” and “Evil Empire” left no doubt about where either stood. But such harsh depictions did not freeze meaningful contact, candid conversation, and even constructive compromise. If anything, these claims freed leaders to pursue negotiations from the safety of the moral high ground.

Do strategy. In today’s Washington, strategic thinking is marginalized or even mocked. President Clinton once mused that in this fast-changing world, foreign policy had become a version of jazz: the art of improvisation. Among the dumbest statements of one of America’s smartest presidents—Barack Obama—was his claim that, given the pace of change today, “I don’t really even need George Kennan.”6 Though deliberate crafting of strategy does not guarantee success, the absence of a coherent, sustainable strategy is a reliable route to failure. Policymakers in Washington today often do not even pretend to take strategy seriously. Instead, addressing challenges posed by China, Russia, or Islamic jihadism, they say, “Our lines of effort are . . .” Official national security strategy documents are ignored. Over the past decade, I have yet to meet a senior member of the US national security team who had so much as read the official national security strategies. Thus, instead of NSC-68, or the Reagan administration’s revision, NSDD-75, what guides the Washington agenda on China today are grand, politically appealing aspirations with a list of assorted actions attached. In each case, a serious strategist would judge the stated objective unachievable by any level of undertaking the US can reasonably mount. Current efforts are thus bound to fail.

I am a congenital optimist about America, but I worry that American democracy is exhibiting fatal symptoms. DC has become an acronym for Dysfunctional Capital: a swamp in which partisanship has grown poisonous, relations between the White House and Congress have paralyzed basic functions like budgets and foreign agreements, and public trust in government has all but disappeared. These symptoms are rooted in the decline of a public ethic, legalized and institutionalized corruption, a poorly educated and attention-deficit-driven electorate, and a “gotcha” press—all exacerbated by digital devices and platforms that reward sensationalism and degrade deliberation. As Abraham Lincoln warned prophetically, a house divided against itself cannot stand.

In Gorin-no-sho and other works, Musashi gives few details about his life. He mentions only that his first life-or-death duel occurred at the age of thirteen and that he spent the next fifteen years traveling and dueling throughout the land. Realizing at the end of this period that his triumphs in over sixty mortal contests were due more to luck than to any real knowledge or skill, he reached an impasse. At the age of thirty, he decided to dedicate the remainder of his life to the pursuit of a greater truth. Following years of austere training and meditation, he eventually saw that the principles for success in swordsmanship and dueling also lead to accomplishment in all other aspects of life. It was this epiphany and wisdom that forms the core message of Musashi’s book and what makes it universal, enduring and timeless.

National sports teams such as football, for example, are called Samurai Blue. The baseball team is known as Samurai Japan.

Professional historians, by contrast, have until very recently tended to ignore, or at least to downplay, the role of networks. Even today, the majority of academic historians tend to study the kinds of institution that create and preserve archives, as if those that do not leave an orderly paper trail simply do not count. Again, my research and my experience have taught me to beware the tyranny of the archives. Often the biggest changes in history are the achievements of thinly documented, informally organized groups of people.

This book is about the uneven ebb and flow of history. It distinguishes the long epochs in which hierarchical structures dominated human life from the rarer but more dynamic eras when networks had the advantage, thanks in part to changes in technology. To put it simply: when hierarchy is the order of the day, you are only as powerful as your rung on the organizational ladder of a state, corporation or similar vertically ordered institution. When networks gain an advantage, you can be as powerful as your position in one or more horizontally structured social groups. As we shall see, this dichotomy between hierarchy and network is an over-simplification. Nevertheless, some personal disclosures may illustrate its usefulness as a starting point.

Some among my contemporaries pursued wealth; few achieved it without at least a period of indentured servitude, usually working for a bank. Others pursued power; they too rose through the party ranks and must marvel today at the indignities they once endured. There are humiliations in the early years of academic life, no doubt, but nothing to compare with being an intern at Goldman Sachs or a lowly campaign volunteer for the losing candidate of a party in opposition. To enter the hierarchy is to abase oneself, at least at first.

This book is an attempt to atone for those sins of omission. It tells the story of the interaction between networks and hierarchies from ancient times until the very recent past. It brings together theoretical insights from myriad disciplines, ranging from economics to sociology, from neuroscience to organizational behaviour. Its central thesis is that social networks have always been much more important in history than most historians, fixated as they have been on hierarchical organizations such as states, have allowed – but never more so than in two periods. The first ‘networked era’ followed the introduction of the printing press to Europe in the late fifteenth century and lasted until the end of the eighteenth century. The second – our own time – dates from the 1970s, though I argue that the technological revolution we associate with Silicon Valley was more a consequence than a cause of a crisis of hierarchical institutions. The intervening period, from the late 1790s until the late 1960s, saw the opposite trend: hierarchical institutions re-established their control and successfully shut down or co-opted networks. The zenith of hierarchically organized power was in fact the mid-twentieth century – the era of totalitarian regimes and total war.

These relationships are forged and maintained in an even smaller number of institutions: the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Goldman Sachs, the World Economic Forum, three philanthropic entities, among them the Clinton Global Initiative, and the Four Seasons restaurant in New York.7 Yet one of the core messages of Donald J.

According to the evolutionary anthropologist Robin Dunbar, our larger brain, with its more developed neocortex, evolved to enable us to function in relatively large social groups of around 150 (compared with around fifty for chimpanzees).11 Indeed, our species should really be known as Homo dictyous (‘network man’) because – to quote the sociologists Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler – ‘our brains seem to have been built for social networks’.12

In prehistory, Homo sapiens evolved as a cooperative ape, with a unique ability to network – to communicate and to act collectively – that set us apart from all other animals. In the words of the evolutionary biologist Joseph Henrich, we are not simply bigger-brained, less hairy chimpanzees; the secret of our success as a species ‘resides . . . in the collective brains of our communities’.10 Unlike chimpanzees, we learn socially, by teaching and sharing.

The term coined by the ethnographer Edwin Hutchins was ‘distributed cognition’. Our early ancestors were ‘obligate collaborative foragers’, who became interdependent on each other for food, shelter and warmth.13 It is likely that the development of spoken language, as well as the associated advances in brain capacity and structure, was part of this same process, evolving out of ape-like practices such as grooming.

Students of corporate governance have long been aware of the role of networks of interlocking directorships in some economies. Japanese keiretsu groups are only one of many such business networks. Such arrangements recall Adam Smith’s famous observation that ‘People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.’* Some scholars of politics, too, have become uneasily aware that networks occupy some intermediate terrain.

Can such graphs show us which individuals are important? It was not until the twentieth century that scholars and mathematicians formally defined importance as ‘centrality’. The three most important measures of importance in formal network analysis are degree centrality, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality. Degree centrality – the number of edges radiating out from a specific node – captures what might be called sociability: the simple number of relationships an individual has to others. Formalized by the sociologist Linton Freeman in the late seventies, betweenness centrality measures the extent to which information passes through a particular node. Just as commuters, by individually seeking the shortest route to their destination, concentrate traffic in a few congested intersections, so too people in a network often rely on key individuals to connect them to otherwise distant individuals or groups. The individuals with high betweenness centrality are not necessarily the people with the most connections, but the ones with the important connections. (In other words, it’s not how many people you know that matters; it’s who you know.) Finally, closeness centrality measures the average number of ‘steps’ it takes for a node to reach all other nodes and is often used to discover who has the best access to information, assuming that this is widely distributed.9 In their different ways, individuals in social networks with high degree centrality, betweenness centrality or closeness centrality act as ‘hubs’.

The fact that we are all nevertheless just six degrees away from Monica Lewinsky is explained by what the Stanford sociologist Mark Granovetter called, paradoxically, ‘the strength of weak ties’.1 If all ties were like the strong, homophilic ones between us and our close friends, the world would necessarily be fragmented. But weaker ties – to the ‘acquaintances’ we do not so closely resemble – are the key to the ‘small world’ phenomenon. Granovetter’s initial focus was on the way people looking for jobs were helped more by acquaintances than by their close friends, but a later insight was that, in a society with relatively few weak ties, ‘new ideas will spread slowly, scientific endeavours will be handicapped, and subgroups separated by race, ethnicity, geography, or other characteristics will have difficulty reaching a modus vivendi’.2 Weak ties, in other words, are the vital bridges between disparate clusters that would otherwise not be connected at all.3

The phrase ‘to go viral’ has become a tiresome cliché, the holy grail of advertisers and marketers.19 Nevertheless, network science offers the best way of understanding why some ideas can spread very rapidly. Ideas – and indeed emotional states and conditions such as obesity – can be transmitted through a social network, not unlike a contagious virus. However, ideas (or ‘memes’, to use the evolutionist’s neologism) are generally less contagious than viruses. Biological and computer viruses typically carry out a ‘broadcast search’ across a network, as their goal is to spread themselves as far as possible, targeting every neighbour of every node they infect. We, by contrast, instinctively select the members of our network to whom we want to communicate an idea or from whom we are likely to accept one as credible.20

The key point, as with disease epidemics, is that network structure can be as important as the idea itself in determining the speed and extent of diffusion.25 In the process of going viral, a key role is played by nodes that are not merely hubs or brokers but ‘gate-keepers’ – people who decide whether or not to pass information to their part of the network.26 Their decision will be based partly on how they think that information will reflect back on them. Acceptance of an idea, in turn, can require it to be transmitted by more than one or two sources. A complex cultural contagion, unlike a simple disease epidemic, first needs to attain a critical mass of early adopters with high degree centrality (relatively large numbers of influential friends).27 In the words of Duncan Watts, the key to assessing the likelihood of a contagion-like cascade is ‘to focus not on the stimulus itself but on the structure of the network the stimulus hits’.28 This helps explain why, for every idea that goes viral, there are countless others that fizzle out in obscurity because they began with the wrong node, cluster or network.

Most of us are ready to give it our all when we start a job. We are usually full of ideas for ways to do things better. We eagerly offer our whole intellectual capacity only to be told that it’s not our job, that it’s been tried before, or that we shouldn’t rock the boat. Initiative is viewed with skepticism. Our suggestions are ignored. We are told to follow instructions. Our work is reduced to following a set of prescriptions. Our creativity and innovations go unappreciated. Eventually, we stop trying and just toe the line. With resignation, we get by. Too often that’s where the story of our work life ends.

In other words, leadership in the Navy, and in most organizations, is about controlling people. It divides the world into two groups of people: leaders and followers. Most of what we study, learn, and practice in terms of leadership today follows this leader-follower structure. This model has been with us for a long time. It is pervasive. It is the structure depicted in The Iliad, in Beowulf, and in other Western epics. It permeates some of the most popular novels and movies about leadership, such as Patrick O’Brian’s Master and Commander.

In our modern world, the most important work we do is cognitive; so, it’s not surprising that a structure developed for physical work isn’t optimal for intellectual work. People who are treated as followers have the expectations of followers and act like followers. As followers, they have limited decision-making authority and little incentive to give the utmost of their intellect, energy, and passion. Those who take orders usually run at half speed, underutilizing their imagination and initiative. While this doesn’t matter much for rowing a trireme, it’s everything for operating a nuclear-powered submarine. This is a recognized limitation of the leader-follower model. We’re taught the solution is empowerment. The problem with empowerment programs is that they contain an inherent contradiction between the message and the method. While the message is “empowerment,” the method—it takes me to empower you—fundamentally disempowers employees. That drowns out the message.

First, though I liked the idea of empowerment, I didn’t understand why empowerment was needed. It seemed to me that humans are born in a state of action and natural empowerment. After all, it wasn’t likely that a species that was naturally passive could have taken over the planet. Empowerment programs appeared to be a reaction to the fact that we had actively disempowered people. Additionally, it seemed inherently contradictory to have an empowerment program whereby I would empower my subordinates and my boss would empower me. I felt my power came from within, and attempts to empower me felt like manipulation.

Many empowerment programs fail because they are just that, “programs” or “initiatives” rather than the central principle—the genetic code, if you will—behind how the organization does business. You can’t “direct” empowerment programs. Directed empowerment programs are flawed because they are predicated on this assumption: I have the authority and ability to empower you (and you don’t). Fundamentally, that’s disempowering. This internal contradiction dooms these initiatives. We say “empowerment” but do it in a way that is disempowering. The practice outweighs the rhetoric.

In response to a recent navigational problem on another submarine, a force-wide directive had added the XO, second in command, to the review process. The Navy commonly added such steps for the force to perform in order to prevent recurrence. (Steps are rarely removed.) Unfortunately, often these additional steps don’t prevent recurrence and sometimes make matters worse. It’s like adding inspectors at the end of the process to see if it’s gone well—extra work without making anything better.

There was another human tendency working against us as well. Subordinates generally desire to present the boss with a “perfect” product the first time. Unfortunately, this gets in the way of efficiency because significant effort can be wasted. We decided then and there that at each phase in the review process the navigator or the assistant navigator should talk to me. These would be quick conversations. On their part, the review team needed to overcome a fear of criticism of an incomplete plan; on my part, I needed to refrain from jumping in with answers. We boiled this down to this motto: “A little rudder far from the rocks is a lot better than a lot of rudder close to the rocks.”

SHORT, EARLY CONVERSATIONS is a mechanism for CONTROL. It is a mechanism for control because the conversations did not consist of me telling them what to do. They were opportunities for the crew to get early feedback on how they were tackling problems. This allowed them to retain control of the solution. These early, quick discussions also provided clarity to the crew about what we wanted to accomplish. Many lasted only thirty seconds, but they saved hours of time.

A commanding officer’s attention is no doubt highly valuable time for the organization, and the hierarchy was supposed to protect that time. Inefficiencies in my time were highly visible, especially to me. Less visible, however, were the inefficiencies of all the people throughout the organization. In my organization, even accounting for the difference in the value of our time, those inefficiencies overwhelmingly outweighed whatever efficiency I was getting with my time as captain. Furthermore, supervisors needed to recognize that the demand for perfect products the first time they see them results in significant waste and frustration throughout their organization. Even a thirty-second check early on could save your people numerous hours of work. Many, many times I’d be walking around the boat and ask someone, “Show me what you are working on,” only to discover that a well-meaning yet erroneous translation of intent was resulting in a significant waste of resources.

You need to change that cycle. Here are a few ways to try to get your team thinking for themselves: If the decision needs to be made urgently, make it, then have the team “red-team” the decision and evaluate it. If the decision needs to be made reasonably soon, ask for team input, even briefly, then make the decision. If the decision can be delayed, then force the team to provide inputs. Do not force the team to come to consensus; that results in whitewashing differences and dissenting votes. Cherish the dissension. If everyone thinks like you, you don’t need them.

ELIMINATING TOP-DOWN MONITORING SYSTEMS is a mechanism for CONTROL. Sure, I was worried that a lot of stuff would slip through the cracks and Santa Fe would get a reputation for not getting the work done, but that didn’t happen. I won’t say that we never again received a message zinging us for not reporting something, but they were easily remedied and not that important. What was incredibly powerful was the idea that everyone was responsible for their own performance and the performance of their departments; that we weren’t going to spend a lot of effort telling them what to do.

When it comes to processes, adherence to the process frequently becomes the objective, as opposed to achieving the objective that the process was put in place to achieve. The goal then becomes to avoid errors in the process, and when errors are made, additional overseers and inspectors are added. These overseers don’t do anything to actually achieve the objective. They only identify when the process has gone bad after the fact.

In his book Out of the Crisis, W. Edwards Deming lays out the leadership principles that became known as TQL, or Total Quality Leadership. This had a big effect on me. It showed me how efforts to improve the process made the organization more efficient, while efforts to monitor the process made the organization less efficient. What I hadn’t understood was the pernicious effect that “We are checking up on you” has on initiative, vitality, and passion until I saw it in action on Santa Fe. TQL is now viewed as a passed fad. The Navy botched the introduction of TQL (done in a non-TQL way) so it’s a bad word to many. That’s too bad, because there are a lot of valuable ideas embedded in Deming’s thinking. I recommend his writings to you.

It would not require too many additional edges in figure 9 to destroy the ruling node’s near monopoly on communication. This helps explain why emperors and kings throughout history have fretted about conspiracies. Cabals, camarillas, cells, cliques, coteries: all such terms have sinister connotations in the context of a monarchical court. Hierarchs have long been uneasily aware that fraternizing amongst subordinates can be the prelude to a palace coup.

Not all networks are likely to foster change; on the contrary, some dense and clustered networks have the tendency to resist it. But the point of contact between diverse networks may be the place to look for novelty.3 The question is what the nature of that point of contact is. Networks can meet and fuse amicably, but they may also attack one another, as happened (in an example to be discussed below) when Soviet intelligence successfully penetrated the elite networks of Cambridge students in the 1930s. In such contests, the outcome will be determined by the relative strengths and weaknesses of the rival networks. How adaptable and resilient are they? How vulnerable to a disruptive contagion? How reliant on one or more ‘superhubs’, the destruction or capture of which would significantly reduce the stability of the whole network?

Barabási and his colleagues simulated attacks on scale-free networks and found that they could withstand the loss of a significant fraction of nodes, and even of a single hub. But a targeted attack on multiple hubs could break the network up altogether.4 Even more dramatically, a scale-free network could quite easily fall victim to a contagious node-killing virus.

Networks may be spontaneously creative but they are not strategic. The Second World War could not have been won by a network, even if superior networks (of atomic scientists or cryptographers) played an important part in the Allied victory. Not only that, but networks are as capable of creating and spreading bad ideas as good ideas. In cases of social contagion or ‘cascades’ of ideas, networks can spread panics as readily as they can communicate the wisdom of crowds – crazes for burning witches as easily as harmless manias for photographs of cats.

For the historian, then, the insights of network theory, in all its forms, have profound implications. I have tried to sum them up here under seven headings: No man is an island. Conceived of as nodes in networks, individuals can be understood in terms of their relationships to other nodes: the edges that connect them. Not all nodes are equal. Located in a network, an individual can be assessed in terms not only of degree centrality (the number of her relationships), but also of betweenness centrality (the likelihood of her being a bridge between other nodes). (Other metrics include eigenvector centrality, which measures proximity to popular or prestigious nodes, though this will not feature in what follows.1) As we shall see, an important but neglected measure of an individual’s historical importance is the extent to which that person was a network bridge. Sometimes, as in the case of the American Revolution, crucial roles turn out to have been played by people who were not leaders but connectors.

Birds of a feather flock together. Because of homophily, social networks can be understood partly in terms of like attracting like. However, it is not always self-evident which shared attribute or preference causes people to cluster together. Moreover, we must be clear about the nature of the network linkages. Are the links between nodes relationships of acquaintance or amity? Are we looking at a family tree or a circle of friends or a secret society? Does something other than knowledge – money, say, or some other resource – get exchanged within the network? No network graph can do justice to the rich complexity of human interactions, but we sometimes know enough to differentiate between the directions of edges (e.g. A commands B, but not vice versa), their modes (e.g. A knows B but sleeps with C), and their weights (e.g. A occasionally meets B but sees C every day).

Weak ties are strong. It also matters how dense a network is, and how connected it is to other clusters, even if it is only through a few weak links. Is it a component of a larger network? Are there ‘network isolates’, nodes that are wholly ‘off the grid’ like Burns’s misanthrope? Are there brokers seeking to exploit structural holes in the network? Does the network exhibit ‘small world’ properties – and, if so, how small is the world (i.e. how many degrees of separation are there between nodes)? How modular is the network’s structure?

Structure determines virality. Many historians still tend to assume that the spread of an idea or an ideology is a function of its inherent content in relation to some vaguely specified context. We must now acknowledge, however, that some ideas go viral because of structural features of the network through which they spread. They are least likely to do so in a hierarchical, top-down network, where horizontal peer-to-peer links are prohibited.

Networks never sleep. Networks are not static, but dynamic. Whether they are random or scale-free, they are prone to phase transitions. They can evolve into complex adaptive systems with emergent properties. Very small changes – the addition of just a few edges – can radically alter the network’s behaviour.

Though its roots lay in the brotherhoods of medieval stonemasons, by the eighteenth century Freemasonry was itself a rapidly growing network that, beginning in Scotland and England, offered male sociability exalted by mythology and ritual, uninhibited by the status difference between aristocracy and bourgeoisie.* It had spread rapidly throughout Germany, including the southern German states, despite efforts by the Roman Catholic Church to prohibit Catholics from becoming Masons.4 It was the suggestion of Franz Xaver Zwackh, one of Weishaupt’s pupils, to recruit Illuminati within German lodges, exploiting the mounting dissatisfaction of many Freemasons with their own movement.

The Illuminati did not cause the French Revolution, much less Napoleon’s rise – though they certainly benefited from it (all but Weishaupt were pardoned and some, notably Dalberg, became very powerful). Far from continuing their plot for world government down to the present, they ceased to operate in the 1780s and efforts to revive the order in the twentieth century were largely bogus.* Nevertheless, their story is an integral part of the complex historical process that led Europe from Enlightenment to Revolution to Empire – a process in which intellectual networks unquestionably played a decisive role.

For example, we shut valves, we don’t close them, because “close” could be confused with “blow.” We prepare to snorkel, but then we report being ready—not prepared—to snorkel. This adherence to formal communications unfortunately crowds out the less formal but highly important contextual information needed for peak team performance. Words like “I think . . .” or “I am assuming . . .” or “It is likely . . .” that are not specific and concise orders get written up by inspection teams as examples of informal communications, a big no-no.

We called this “thinking out loud.” We worked hard on this issue of communication. It was for everyone. I would think out loud when I’d say, in general, here’s where we need to be, and here’s why. They would think out loud with worries, concerns, and thoughts. It’s not what we picture when we think of the movie image of the charismatic and confident leader, but it creates a much more resilient system. Later, even though Santa Fe was performing at the top of the fleet, officers steeped in the leader-follower mind-set would criticize what they viewed as the informal communications on Santa Fe. If you limit all discussion to crisp orders and eliminate all contextual discussion, you get a pretty quiet control room. That was viewed as good. We cultivated the opposite approach and encouraged a constant buzz of discussions among the watch officers and crew. By monitoring that level of buzz, more than the actual content, I got a good gauge of how well the ship was running and whether everyone was sharing information.

There’s no room in our military language and no pictures in our heads for the kinds of context-rich conversations that are critical to good team performance. We aren’t comfortable talking about hunches or gut feelings or anything with probabilities attached to it.

THINK OUT LOUD also works as a mechanism for ORGANIZATIONAL CLARITY. If all you need your people to do is follow orders, it isn’t important that they understand what you are trying to accomplish. But we operate in a highly complex world, with the vagaries of an ever-changing environment and the opposition of a diligent and patient enemy. It’s not enough to put a finger on the chart and hope things come out well. When I, as the captain, would “think out loud,” I was in essence imparting important context and experience to my subordinates. I was also modeling that lack of certainty is strength and certainty is arrogance.

Mechanism: Embrace the Inspectors We applied “embrace the inspectors” not only to one-time critiques and problems such as the shore power mishap, but also to entire inspections. We would utilize the inspectors to disseminate our ideas throughout the squadron, to learn from others, and to document issues to improve the ship. This mechanism sends the signal that we are in charge of our destiny, not controlled by some force. It runs counter to the instincts expressed by many of my officers and chiefs to minimize the ship’s visibility to the outside, especially when problems were involved. EMBRACE THE INSPECTORS is a mechanism for CONTROL, organizational control. In other words, the crew of Santa Fe are responsible for Santa Fe. We found we needed this parallelism with internal control. Later, we’d hand out T-shirts that jokingly read, “DON’T BE A VICTIM.” Concerning areas where we were doing something exceptionally innovative or expertly, we viewed the inspectors as advocates to share our good practices with. Concerning areas where we were doing things poorly and needed help, we viewed them as sources of information and solutions. This created an atmosphere of learning and curiosity among the crew, as opposed to an attitude of defensiveness.

Embrace the inspectors turned out to be an incredibly powerful vehicle for learning. Whenever an inspection team was on board, I would hear crew members saying things like, “I’ve been having a problem with this. What have you seen other ships do to solve it?” Most inspection teams found this attitude remarkable.

We ran through all the usual suspects. First, it was suggested that we do some refresher training, a commonly proposed solution. “Let me ask you this. Training implies a knowledge deficiency. I should be able to identify that with a test. So what question on a test do you think any of these guys would have gotten wrong?” No one could think of one. It wasn’t a knowledge deficiency, and training wasn’t the solution. “We need to add supervision.” This is another favorite solution, like adding the XO to the chart review process. We discussed what a supervisor would do, where he would stand, and how he could have prevented this mistake. Grudgingly, it was agreed that adding a supervisor might have prevented shutting down the second and third breakers, but not the first.

“Well, he was just in auto. He didn’t engage his brain before he did what he did; he was just executing a procedure.” I thought that was perceptive. We discussed a mechanism for engaging your brain before acting. We decided that when operating a nuclear-powered submarine we wanted people to act deliberately, and we decided on “take deliberate action” as our mechanism. This meant that prior to any action, the operator paused and vocalized and gestured toward what he was about to do, and only after taking a deliberate pause would he execute the action. Our intent was to eliminate those “automatic” mistakes. Since the goal of “take deliberate action” was to introduce deliberateness in the mind of the operator, it didn’t matter whether anyone was around or not. Deliberate actions were not performed for the benefit of an observer or an inspector. They weren’t for show.

With the perspective of needing to increase technical competence in mind, we thought about the simple reality “we learn,” and that’s what we adopted. It was something that every member of the crew did every day. It seemed to be the basic element that unified all of our actions. No matter what we were doing, we would figure out how to extract the maximum learning from that event. Our philosophy was that we just didn’t have time to add a bunch of lectures, but the submarine gave us hundreds of opportunities a day to learn. Once we started looking for those learning opportunities, we found them everywhere. We ended up codifying the philosophy of “we learn” with a statement of our creed.

USS Santa Fe Creed What do we do on a day-to-day basis? We learn. Why is “learning” a better word than “training”? Training implies passivity; it is done to us. We are trained; we attend training. Learning is active; it is something we do. What do we learn? We learn how to prepare a submarine for success in combat. Why would we need to go to combat? We would go to combat if called upon by our country to defend the Constitution of the United States. Why is that important? The personal liberty, well-being, and economic prosperity we enjoy in the United States are unique throughout the history of mankind. Man’s life has generally been short, hard, and brutish. The democratic system we have and the importance of individual rights specified by the Constitution are the reasons for our emotional and physical prosperity. It’s an important document, worthy of being defended. You are not alone in deciding this, as many have died defending the Constitution before you. Why submarines? Submarines can accomplish unique missions no other platform can accomplish. The American submarine force has a tremendous heritage of defending democracy. For example, during World War II, the submarine force, while only making up 2 percent of the Navy, sank over 50 percent of all Japanese vessels sunk. This was a critical contribution to winning that war. If all we do is learn, how does the work get done? We do the work. But, we learn by doing—maintenance, evolutions, casualty drills, studying. So, when we are working, even doing field day, we are learning. It seems like a trick; we’re still doing the same thing, we’re just calling it something different. Yes and no. Yes, in that we will still keep the boat clean, drill, do maintenance, qualify, and the myriad other tasks that take up our time. No, in that how you look at things makes a difference. Instead of looking at a task as just a chore, look at it as an opportunity to learn more about the associated piece of equipment, the procedure, or if nothing else, about how to delegate or accomplish tasks. How does the training program fit in? The training program is a part of the learning process, but by no means all of it. Training is a subset of learning, which in turn is a subset of personal growth. We strive to grow each day. Therefore, our vision of our command is a learning and competence factory. The raw materials are the new personnel reporting aboard each week, new equipment, and tactics. The product is well-qualified, experienced sailors who, upon detaching from the command, carry their competence throughout the Navy. Each of you, then, is both a product of the factory (when you learn) and a machine in the factory (when you help others learn). What do you expect me to do? I expect you to learn to be a better submariner each day. I challenge you to look at each field day, maintenance action, drill, monitor watch, underway, and deployment as an opportunity to learn more, and by doing so, to grow as a person.

We decided to do away with briefs. From that point on we would do certifications. A certification is different from a brief in that during a certification, the person in charge of his team asks them questions. This could be the Chief in Charge—as in the case I’m recounting—or a lead surgeon prior to an operation. At the end of the certification, a decision is made whether or not the team is ready to perform the upcoming operation.

Repeat the same message day after day, meeting after meeting, event after event. Sounds redundant, repetitive, and boring. But what’s the alternative? Changing the message? That results in confusion and a lack of direction. I didn’t realize the degree to which old habits die hard, even when people are emotionally on board with the change. The chiefs wanted to be on board, but they pictured a leadership approach, a style, they’d seen before on the “USS Ustafish”—the generic term for the submarine I “used to” be on.

Thereafter, whenever we talked about deliberate action, we talked about multiple benefits. Not only did it minimize the chance of a mistake by a person by himself and provide an opportunity for drill team intervention; it was also a critical aspect of teamwork. It worked in a couple ways. It was a bottom-up way of signaling action. It also worked because adjacent watch standers could correct potential mistakes before they happened.

Though less well known than the Medici, Benedetto Cotrugli is a perfect illustration of the ways that European networks were evolving in the Renaissance era – ways that created a new cosmopolitan class of interconnected individuals. Cotrugli’s Book of the Art of Trade is, it is tempting to suggest, the fifteenth-century equivalent of Donald Trump’s Art of the Deal. However, Cotrugli was no Trump. Amongst many pieces of wise advice, Cotrugli warns merchants against involving themselves in politics. ‘It is not expedient,’ he writes, ‘for a merchant to have to do with the courts, nor above all to involve himself in politics or the civil administration, because these are perilous areas.’1 Far from glorying in verbal vulgarity and ostentatious displays of wealth, Cotrugli was a highly educated humanist whose ideal merchant embodied the classical virtues of the commoner-citizen as they had been conceived by the ancient Greeks and Romans and rediscovered by Italian scholars in the Renaissance.

Yet Cotrugli’s was a life well lived. He might have missed the libraries of Bologna, but he took considerable pride in his commercial calling. Indeed, parts of The Art of Trade read as a defence of merchants against the charges – of usury, of greed, of avarice – frequently levelled at them by religious zealots at the time. Cotrugli declared himself ‘astonished that exchange, being so useful, easy and entirely necessary to the conduct of human affairs, should be condemned by so many theologians’.4

‘A merchant,’ writes Cotrugli, ‘should be the most universal of men and one that has the most to do, more than his fellows, with different types of men and social classes’ (my emphasis). Consequently, ‘everything a man might know may be helpful to a merchant’, including cosmography, geography, philosophy, astrology, theology and law. In short, The Book of the Art of Trade can also be read as a manifesto for a new society of networked polymaths.

A third difference was that whereas the Asian empires that the Portuguese encountered were able to withstand their incursions, making only minor territorial concessions, the American empires the Spaniards attacked collapsed with astonishing speed. This owed much more to the devastating effects of the infectious Eurasian diseases brought by the Spaniards across the Atlantic than to any technological advantage. In other respects, however, what happened when Francisco Pizarro and his 167 associates encountered the Inca Atahualpa at Cajamarca in November 1532 was similar to what had happened in Guangdong a decade earlier. In essence, a European network attacked a non-European hierarchy. The conquistadores were a motley gang. They were tough, no doubt, as their long march southward had been as arduous as any Atlantic crossing. With their horses, guns (arquebuses) and steel swords, they were also better armed than the indigenous Mayan peoples of Peru, whose weapon of choice was a wooden club. Like the Portuguese discoverers, their primary motive was economic: they came not to trade but to plunder the plentiful gold and silver of the Inca empire.

Yet the most striking characteristic of the conquistadors was their propensity to quarrel, often bloodily, amongst themselves. The animus of Pizarro’s brother Hernando against Diego de Almagro was just one of many feuds. It was not the strength of the Spanish invaders that doomed the Inca empire, but the empire’s weakness.

Prior to the Reformation, there had been relatively little to distinguish the economic performance of north-western Europe from that of, say, the Chinese or Ottoman empires. After Luther’s revolution, Protestant states began to show signs of greater economic dynamism. Why was this? One answer is that, despite Luther’s desire to purify the Church, the Reformation led to a large-scale reallocation of resources from religious to secular activities. Two thirds of monasteries were closed in the Protestant territories of Germany, the lands and other assets mostly appropriated by secular rulers and sold to wealthy subjects, as also happened in England. A rising share of university students gave up thoughts of the monastic life, turning their attention to more worldly vocations. Church-building diminished; secular construction increased. As has been justly observed, the Reformation had wholly unintended consequences, in that it was ‘a religious movement that contributed to Europe’s secularization’.2

By contrast, the Académie des sciences in Paris was originally the private property of the crown. When it met for the first time on 22 December 1666, it was in the king’s library and had an official policy of secrecy. All discussion and deliberation was private, and non-members were barred from sessions.8 Its members were thus effectively removed from the rapidly growing pan-European network that would produce the Scientific Revolution. The position was similar in much of Catholic Europe.

Freemasonry furnished the Age of Reason with a powerful mythology, an international organizational structure and an elaborate ritual calculated to bind initiates together as metaphorical brothers. Like much else that transformed the eighteenth-century world, its origins were Scottish. European stonemasons had certainly organized themselves into lodges in the Middle Ages, and had (like other medieval crafts) distinguished between apprentices, journeymen and masters, but these organizations were not greatly formalized before the late fourteenth century. In 1598 the Scottish lodges were given a new set of regulations, known as the Schaw Statues after William Schaw, the Principal Master of Work to the Crown. It was not until the mid-seventeenth century, however, that Freemasonry evolved into something more than a loose network of guilds of skilled craftsmen, with lodges in Kilwinning and Edinburgh admitting ‘speculative’ or ‘accepted’ (i.e. non-practising) Masons. It was an Aberdonian, James Anderson, whose book The Constitutions of the Free-Masons (1723) provided the new era with an appropriately grandiose prehistory. In Anderson’s narrative,* the Supreme Architect of the Universe had endowed Adam with the skills of masonry – geometry and the ‘mechanical arts’ – which he then passed on to his progeny, who in turn transmitted them to the Old Testament prophets. God’s chosen people were ‘good Masons before they possess’d the promis’d land’,

Technologically there was little real difference between the armies Frederick and Napoleon commanded. Yet everything the latter did was on a larger scale* and at a faster speed. The two great military theorists of the age, Carl von Clausewitz and Antoine-Henri de Jomini, drew somewhat different lessons from Napoleon’s success. For Clausewitz, Napoleon’s genius lay in his ability to concentrate his forces rapidly at the enemy’s centre of gravity (the Schwerpunkt) and to defeat him in a decisive battle, the Hauptschlacht. For Jomini, the key was his ability to exploit the advantages of superior interior lines of operation (lignes d’opérations). Jomini thought Napoleon was applying universal principles of warfare.12 Clausewitz saw that Napoleon’s style of warfare was historically specific because of the way it tapped the popular nationalism that the French Revolution had unleashed.13

Put differently, the international order was now clearly a hierarchical system, but with five hubs playing the dominant role. Those five nodes could link together in a variety of different combinations – could indeed quarrel amongst themselves – but never between 1815 and 1914 did they all go to war. Although the system was not so stable as to avoid war altogether, the conflicts between Waterloo and the Marne were far less destructive than the one that had gone before and the one what was to follow.

The restoration of order to Europe after Napoleon required more than just a new diplomatic hierarchy that ranked five states above all the rest, however. Of comparable importance was the way that the institution of monarchy itself was re-legitimized. In this process, an often overlooked role was played by an old-fashioned kind of network, namely the intertwined genealogies of European royalty. One family in particular played a crucial role in reconciling the hereditary principle with the new ideals of constitutional government that so many nineteenth-century liberals embraced. Coburg was one of those petty German states that had been threatened with extinction when Napoleon swept away the Holy Roman Empire and created the Confederation of the Rhine.

One of the crucial ways in which the Rothschilds endeared themselves to the political elite (as well as outdoing their business competitors) was by having an exceptional intelligence and communications network. In this period, postal services were slow and insecure: letters sent from Paris to Frankfurt usually took just forty-eight hours in 1814; but mail from London could take up to a week to reach Frankfurt, and the service from Paris to Berlin took nine days in 1817.10 Compulsive correspondents as they were, the brothers soon dispensed with the post, relying instead on their own private couriers, including agents at Dover who were authorized to charter boats for Rothschild business.11

All over the European Continent in 1848, people who had signed petitions about one grievance or another were swept up in another wave of revolution – this time extending as far as Berlin and Vienna, and leading to Metternich’s downfall.10 There was nothing close to this in Britain.

Poverty alone is seldom enough to drive mass emigrations. What is needed is political upheaval at home and the prospect of a more stable habitat within affordable reach.

Revolutions, wars and the attendant miseries coincided with a steep decline in transport costs. The result was an exodus – or, to be precise, three exoduses, each of comparable magnitudes. The well-known mass migration (55–58 million people) was from Europe to the Americas, principally to the United States.

Although unfashionable amongst historians, Kissinger’s approach finds considerable support amongst political scientists and network theorists. Certainly, the sharp increase in the number of militarized disputes after 1890 supports his argument that there was some kind of change around that time.7 So, too, does an elegant paper by the mathematician Tibor Antal and the physicists Paul Krapivsky and Sidney Redner, who show that – in terms of network theory – the evolution of the great-power system after 1890 was, paradoxically, in the direction of ‘social balance’: two roughly equal alliances emerged. Balance in this case was ‘a natural outcome’, but not a good one if neither side was deterred by the other (see figure 23).

Even before the military stalemate on the Western Front had become apparent, the German government had begun experimenting with what would prove to be the decisive, war-winning weapon. The idea was to destabilize the other side’s empires by unleashing an ideological ‘virus’. With help from their Ottoman allies, the Germans sought to spark a jihad throughout the British Empire, as well as the French.2 The plot of John Buchan’s Greenmantle – which can strike the modern reader as one of his most far-fetched – was therefore based on real events.3 The Germans were right that something like this would work. Yet their first attempt at triggering a revolution failed. The critical point is that only some of the revolutionary ideas of 1914–1918 went viral, in the sense that they spread fast enough and far enough to destabilize and topple an imperial hierarchy. The call to jihad did not undermine British or French rule in those parts of the Muslim world that they controlled, but the British counter-attack in the form of sponsorship of Arab nationalism did indeed undermine the Ottoman Empire, just as the German campaign to spread Bolshevism destroyed the Russian Empire – before sweeping westwards to destroy the German Empire itself. To understand why the first of these initiatives failed while the second succeeded and the third succeeded then backfired, we need to remember that network structures are as important as viruses in determining the speed and extent of a contagion.

In October 1914, Oppenheim responded with a 136-page top-secret ‘Memorandum on the Revolutionizing of the Islamic Territories of Our Enemies’, in which he described Islam as ‘one of our most important weapons’.

The Young Turk leaders, Ismail Enver and Mehmed Taalat, argued that the Entente powers – Britain, France and Russia – were the ones with the lethal designs on Ottoman territory, whereas the Germans and Austrians were honest brokers who might countenance the restoration of at least some of the possessions lost since the 1870s.13 With the Kaiser’s encouragement, an alliance was hastily concluded on 2 August.14 Moreover, Enver and his colleagues were fully persuaded that religious sentiment could be exploited as a source of Ottoman power. They saw it as the crucial bond between Turks and Arabs.15 They also saw it as legitimizing their genocidal campaign against Christians within the Empire, particularly the Armenians.

Most hopeless of all was the ham-fisted bid to bring Mexico into the war by proposing the reconquest of New Mexico, Texas and Arizona, details of which were intercepted by British intelligence and relayed to the United States because, as we have seen, German transatlantic telegrams had to pass through a British relay station.

Yet the one German plot that worked proved to be so successful that it very nearly revolutionized the whole world. This was the plot to send the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, then living in exile in Switzerland, back to Russia, in the wake of the February 1917 Revolution that overthrew Tsar Nicholas II.

The second astonishing thing was how ruthlessly the Bolsheviks turned their revolutionary network into a new hierarchical system, in many respects much harsher than the old Tsarist regime. The Bolshevik Party grew exponentially in size after 1917, but even as it expanded it grew more centralized – an outcome Lenin had anticipated in his pre-war tract What is to be Done? Setbacks in 1918 legitimized Lenin’s urge to play the part of Robespierre, assuming dictatorial powers in the spirit of ‘the Revolution endangered’.

The problem for the planners was that a hierarchical system that had been well-suited to the activity of total war – an activity characterized by monopsony, as the state is the sole buyer, and standardization, as destruction is much simpler than production – was wholly unsuited to a consumer society. Those who had fought in the world wars had been promised prosperity as well as victory. In practice, that could be achieved only if millions of households were freed to make billions of choices, to which hundreds of thousands of firms could respond. The result was rising complexity, in which ‘lateral interactions become much more important, boundaries between sub-systems within [any] organization . . . more fluid’.4 As the physicist Yaneer Bar-Yam has argued, ‘a group of individuals whose collective behaviour is controlled by a single individual cannot behave in a more complex way than the individual who is exercising the control’.

The transition to a more networked world manifested itself in myriad ways in the 1970s. The driver was not so much technological as organizational. Friedrich Hayek was one of the first to rediscover Adam Smith’s old insight that the spontaneous order of the market was bound to be superior to ‘any that could have been achieved by deliberate organization’. As Hayek observed, ‘To maintain that we must deliberately plan modern society because it has become so complex is therefore paradoxical, and the result of a complete misunderstanding . . . The fact is, rather, that we can preserve an order of such complexity . . . only indirectly by enforcing and improving the rules conductive to the formation of a spontaneous order.’6 Others found this out for themselves the hard way.

Kissinger arrived in the White House with an already well-developed intolerance – which the new president shared – of bureaucracy. (This allergy had begun in the Army, where he had most enjoyed the rank-less but powerful role of counter-intelligence agent, and continued throughout his time at Harvard, where his instinct was to establish new institutions rather than bow to the senior faculty and deans.) ‘The spirit of policy and that of bureaucracy are diametrically opposed,’ he had written in his doctoral dissertation. ‘The essence of policy is its contingency; its success depends on the correctness of an estimate which is in part conjectural. The essence of bureaucracy is its quest for safety; its success is calculability . . . The attempt to conduct policy bureaucratically leads to a quest for calculability which tends to become a prisoner of events.’

The best illustration of Kissinger’s argument was the abject failure of US strategy in Vietnam. There was, he wrote after several visits to South Vietnam, ‘no such thing . . . as a Vietnam policy; there is a series of programs of individual agencies concerned with Vietnam. These programs are reconciled or not, as the case may be, if there is a conflict between the operating agencies.’ There were three problems with this. First, the system worked only when there were two opposing agencies, one on either side of an issue; it went awry when a small, dedicated, unopposed group got to work. Second, there could be no planning because no one had time for it. (‘Planning involves conjectures about the future and hypothetical cases. They are so busy with actual cases that they are reluctant to take on theoretical ones.’) Third, policy-makers were plagued by a ‘congenital insecurity’ because they lacked the expertise of their advisers; they therefore sought refuge in ‘a quest for administrative consensus’. All this had disastrous results the moment the United States sought to negotiate an end to the conflict with the formidably intransigent North Vietnamese. There was always a temptation in Washington not to make a decision at all but simply to see, after a negotiation had begun, ‘what the other side had to offer’.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Kissinger complained of the tendency of each president to be ‘confronted with faits accomplis by the bureaucracy which he can ratify or modify but which preclude a real consideration of alternatives’.3 In a 1966 article entitled ‘Domestic Structure and Foreign Policy’, Kissinger observed that the government bureaucracy made ‘a deliberate effort to reduce the relevant elements of a problem to a standard of average performance’. This became a problem when ‘what [the bureaucracy] defines as routine does not address the most significant range of issues or when its prescribed mode of action proves irrelevant to the problem’. At the same time, there was a tendency for inter-departmental ‘bureaucratic contests’ to become the only means of generating decisions, or for the various elements of the bureaucracy to make ‘a series of nonaggression pacts with each other and thus reduce the decision-maker to a benevolent constitutional monarch’. What most people did not understand about presidential speeches on foreign policy, Kissinger argued, is that they were usually intended to ‘settle an internal debate in Washington’.4 In the spring of 1968, just months before being offered the job of national security adviser, Kissinger went so far as to argue that there was ‘no such thing as an American foreign policy’; only ‘a series of moves that have produced a certain result’ that they ‘may not have been planned to produce’ and to which ‘research and intelligence organizations, either foreign or national, attempt to give a rationality and consistency . . . which it simply does not have’. The ‘highest level in which people can still think’ in a government department, he argued, was ‘the middle level of the bureaucracy – that of the assistant secretary and his immediate advisers . . . Above that, the day to day operation of the machine absorbs most of the energy.’ Under these circumstances, ‘decisions do not get made until they appear as an administrative issue’.

Most writers who have studied his subsequent career in Washington have tended to explain the rapid growth of Kissinger’s influence, for better or for worse, in terms of his close relationship to Nixon or his talent for the very bureaucratic infighting he had condemned as an academic. However, this is to overlook the most distinctive feature of Kissinger’s mode of operation. While those around him continued to be bound by the rules of the hierarchical bureaucracy that employed them, Kissinger from the outset devoted considerable energy to building a network that extended horizontally in all directions beyond the Washington Beltway: to the press and even the entertainment industry inside the United States and, perhaps more importantly, to key foreign governments through a variety of ‘back channels’. Kissinger brought to this task an innate capacity to make emotional as well as intellectual connections even with the most aloof of interlocutors, a skill he had honed long before his appointment by Nixon.

As Time put it, Kissinger ‘carefully preserved the ritual required of a subordinate who takes orders from a Commander in Chief’, even as Nixon’s presidency was falling apart. The ‘formal and correct rather than personal’ relationship with Nixon remained institutionally vital until his final resignation. As Time noted, Kissinger had ‘a finely tuned sense of hierarchy’.19 But what mattered much more were all the other relationships in a network – including an ‘old boy network’ of former participants in Kissinger’s summer seminars at Harvard – that spanned the globe. ‘He always looks for the guy who can deliver,’ an unnamed aide told Time. ‘A lot of doors open for him,’ said a ‘Washington friend and admirer’. The network was the precondition for his ‘chain reaction’ diplomacy – a phrase used by the Israeli deputy premier, Yigal Allon. That was what justified the claim that Kissinger ‘probably [had] more impact than any other person in the world’.

How Do We Find Our Purpose? Joanna Macy, an educator, ecologist, and author, has suggested three directions in which to look for your own purpose.2 1. Work with your passion, on projects you care deeply about. What was your dream before you stopped dreaming? What’s the work you would do even if you weren’t paid to do it? You’re not looking for those superficial preferences depicted on bumper stickers, like “I’d rather be surfing.” You’re looking for something you’d give your life to, not something you use to get away from your life. 2. Work with your pain, with people whose pain touches your heart. Have you “been there so you know how it feels”—in grief, sorrow, despair, hunger, terror? Can you offer others the wisdom and compassion you gained from this experience? Is there an aspect of suffering in the world that calls you to action? If you are in such pain that you’ve lost touch with your ability to help others, then now is the perfect time to extend your hand to others in pain. It’s healing. 3. Work with what is at hand, with the opportunities that arise daily for responding to the simple needs of others. Finding your purpose has often been equated with discovering the perfect job or service project that will galvanize you to be as saintly as Mother Teresa. This suggestion to work with what’s at hand is a reminder that in an interconnected world all acts of service contribute to the good of the whole. If you remember that there is no single act of greatness, just a series of small acts done with great passion or great love, then in doing what you see needs to be done—taking dinner to a sick neighbor, helping a child learn to read, writing a letter to the editor of your newspaper, being an advocate for the homeless in your city—you will discover a life filled with the experience of having a purpose worth living for.

Why did hierarchical power structures plunge into crisis in the 1970s? It might be assumed that, as Brzezinski believed, the answer to this question is technological. It is certainly true that the seventies were the decade of genesis for both the personal computer and the Internet. However, the crisis of hierarchical power predated the spread of electronic networking in the United States. Indeed, the causation was the other way around: it was precisely the relaxation of central control that made the American information technology revolution possible.

Conway – a systems analyst with experience of government defence contracts – had observed that: The structures of large systems tend to disintegrate during development, qualitatively more so than with small systems.

Why do large systems disintegrate? The process seems to occur in three steps . . . – First, the realization by the initial designers that the system will be large, together with certain pressures in their organization, make irresistible the temptation to assign too many people to a design effort. – Second, application of the conventional wisdom of management to a large design organization causes its communication structure to disintegrate. – Third, the homomorphism insures that the structure of the system will reflect the disintegration which has occurred in the design organization.3

In his farewell address to the nation in 1960, Eisenhower had warned of the excessive power of the ‘military-industrial complex’. He need not have worried. Had it been so very powerful, it would surely have prevented or at least stunted the exponential growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web. Perhaps the most striking feature of the United States in the 1970s was simply that such decentralized innovation was possible, despite all the economic, social and political troubles we associate with that period.

The causes of the financial crisis can be summarized under six headings. Major banks became dangerously undercapitalized, exploiting regulatory loopholes to increase their leverage ratios. Markets were flooded with asset-backed securities such as collateralized debt obligations that rating agencies egregiously mispriced. The Federal Reserve allowed monetary policy to be too loose between 2002 and 2004. Politicians created economically foolish incentives for poor Americans to become home-owners. Derivatives such as credit default swaps were sold on a massive scale, on the basis of unrealistic risk models. Finally, flows of capital from emerging markets, especially China, to the United States helped to inflate the American real estate bubble.7 The crisis may be said to have begun when that bubble burst: declining house prices and mounting defaults on subprime mortgages were producing signs of financial distress already in late 2006. Yet it was the Lehman bankruptcy – at 1.45 a.m. on Monday, 15 September  – that turned distress into global panic. The parent company’s filing was followed by around eighty insolvency proceedings involving subsidiaries in eighteen foreign countries.

One of the few central bankers to appreciate the importance of this structural change was Andrew Haldane of the Bank of England, who argued that a complex adaptive system had been created that tended to amplify cyclical fluctuations.13 Haldane’s insight drew on the work of John Holland and others on complex systems which, unlike merely complicated systems, have the tendency to change in unpredictable ways. These ‘emergent properties’ were the thing missing from the Fed economists’ model.14 Quite simply, standard macroeconomics omitted network structure. No one had quite noticed that the global financial network had become connected enough for distress to cascade rapidly from one institution to many, but sparse enough for many institutions to be poorly diversified and inadequately insured against the failure of a counterparty.15

First, there is the advantage conferred on the corporate insiders, who alone can afford the huge ‘compliance’ departments that are necessary to navigate the sea of circumlocution. Second, there is the risk of systemic instability, which grows with every increase in overall complexity. Anyone who thinks the global financial system has been made more stable by legislation like Dodd–Frank is an optimist. The very opposite may well be true, as new regulation may have reduced the authorities’ ability to cope with the problem of contagion (e.g. a run on uninsured short-term liabilities).6 Meanwhile, as Francis Fukuyama has argued, the very legitimacy of democratic politics is being corroded because ‘interest groups . . . are able to effectively buy politicians with campaign contributions and lobbying’, a process that he dubs ‘repatrimonialization’.7 Political institutions are at once sclerotic yet seemingly unreformable: the electoral college, the primary system, the arcane rules of the Senate, and so on. The courts are too much involved in both policy-making and administration. Yet no one has a coherent plan to fix any of this.8

At the same time, while very nearly doubling the federal debt, the Obama administration used its regulatory powers to raise money in new ways: more than $100bn in ‘settlements’ of investigations into bank mortgage practices, for example, and $20bn from the BP Horizon oil-spill compensation programme. (It also intervened in the ‘managed bankruptcies’ of General Motors and Chrysler on behalf of political allies.)9 Yet all these expedients of the administrative state impose burdens on the private sector that ultimately reduce the rate of growth and job creation.10 Intergenerational inequity in public finance, hypertrophic growth of regulation, deterioration in the rule of law and corrosion of educational institutions – taken together, these lead to a ‘great degeneration’ of both economic performance and (as we shall see) social cohesion.11 In short, the administrative state represents the last iteration of political hierarchy: a system that spews out rules, generates complexity, and undermines both prosperity and stability.

There are three important caveats, however. First, based on data from the US Survey of Consumer Finance, the increases in the shares of the top 1 per cent and the top 0.1 per cent in both wealth and income have not been quite as large as Piketty and Saez have claimed.5 Second, the number of individuals in the Forbes 400 list who made it onto that list by dint of inherited wealth has declined steadily in our time: from 159 in 1985 to just eighteen in 2009.6 Turnover at the very top has never been higher. Third, the growth of the global middle class – what Marxists preferred to call the bourgeoisie – is as profound a social change as the accumulation of wealth by the 1 per cent. Between 2000 and 2015, the Chinese middle class grew by 38 million; using the same definition, the American middle class also grew, by 13 million. Worldwide, the middle class has grown in size by 178 million, a 31 per cent increase since 2000.7 According to one estimate, the Gini coefficient of global inequality declined from 69 in 2003 to 65 in 2013, and will decline further to 61 in 2035.8 In short, the evidence is compelling that global income distribution has become significantly less unequal since 1970, and that this trend is likely to continue.9 The biggest driver has been the embourgeoisement of China, but that is only around a fifth of the global story.10

From Taksim Gezi Park in Istanbul to the streets of São Paulo, protests swept the world. No matter what the object of the protesters’ ire, their methods followed the Schmidt–Cohen playbook.9 The Spanish philosopher Manuel Castells hastened to celebrate the revolutionary power of the ‘network society’, which created popular movements so large that it was simply impossible to ‘round up the usual suspects’.10 The inference drawn by some was that, under such pressures, more and more corrupt authoritarian states would be forced to become transparent and responsive ‘smart governments’, harnessing technology to make themselves more efficient and accountable. Eventually, every state would end up like Estonia, the pioneer of e-democracy.11

Yet there was intense embarrassment that such popular companies as Yahoo, Google and Microsoft – not to mention Facebook – were in cahoots with the dreaded ‘national security state’, and that the entire operation had continued unabated despite the election of the liberals’ darling, Barack Obama, as president. Under Obama, the NSA collected not only the metadata of phone calls by 120 million Verizon subscribers, but also – under PRISM – the content of email, voice, text and video chats of an unknown number of Americans. Between April 2011 and March 2012, according to an internal NSA audit leaked by Snowden, there were 2,776 breaches of the rules supposed to govern surveillance of citizens.17 It was all very well for Mark Zuckerberg to complain that he had been ‘so confused and frustrated by the repeated reports of the behavior of the U.S. government’ and to declare self-righteously: ‘When our engineers work tirelessly to improve security, we imagine we’re protecting you against criminals, not our own government.’18 But he could hardly have known nothing about what was going on.

There was a further problem with the NSA’s strategy. Quite possibly, its surveillance programme did help prevent further Al-Qaeda attacks. The evidence furnished by Snowden is insufficient to conclude that PRISM was useless. Yet the damage done to the United States’ reputation – especially in the eyes of its allies – surely outweighed whatever benefits there were. It was in the wake of the Snowden leaks that the United States yielded to foreign pressure to end the Department of Commerce’s oversight of ICANN, which is now under the supervision of a ‘global multi-stakeholder community’.

Yet, as Renee DiResta has argued, the digital crowd of the 2010s was fundamentally different from the crowd of the 1930s that had so fascinated and appalled Elias Canetti: The crowd always wants to grow – and always can, unfettered by physical limitations. Within the crowd there is equality – but higher levels of deception, suspicion, and manipulation. The crowd loves density – and digital identities can be more closely packed. The crowd needs a direction – and clickbait makes directions cheap to manufacture.7 Those who had pinned their hopes on the ‘wisdom’ of crowds, fondly imagining a benign ‘crowd-sourced’ politics, were in for a rude awakening. ‘In the presence of social influence,’ as two scholars of networks have observed, ‘people’s actions become dependent on one another, shattering the fundamental assumption behind the wisdom of crowds. When crowds follow their interdependence, they can be leveraged to spread information to the masses, even if it’s incorrect.’8

If social networks were the key to the politics of populism, why were groups less likely to be on Facebook – such as elderly country-dwellers – more likely to vote populist?41 There is an explanation. Social media were undoubtedly used more effectively by Cummings and his counterpart in the Trump campaign, Stephen K. Bannon, than by their opponents. But the populist campaigns would not have been successful if the memes they disseminated had not been spread further in the non-electronic forums where ordinary people meet, and where friendships are real rather than (as on Facebook) fake: pubs and bars. And this, in turn, would not have happened if those memes had not resonated.

In today’s terms, the hierarchy is not a single city but the nation-state itself, the vertically structured super-polity that evolved out of the republics and monarchies of early modern Europe. Though not the most populous nation in the world, the United States is certainly the world’s most powerful state, whatever the vagaries of its political system. Its nearest rival, the People’s Republic of China, is usually seen as a profoundly different kind of state, for while the United States has two major parties, the People’s Republic has one, and only one. The US government is founded on the separation of powers, not least the independence of its judiciary; the PRC subordinates all other institutions, including the courts, to the dictates of the Communist Party. Yet both states are republics, with roughly comparable vertical structures of administration and not wholly dissimilar concentrations of power in the hands of the central government relative to state and local authorities. Economically, the two systems are certainly converging, with China looking ever more to market mechanisms, while the US federal government in recent years has steadily increased the statutory and regulatory power of public agencies over producers and consumers.

And, to an extent that disturbs libertarians on both left and right, the US government exerts control and practises surveillance over its citizens in ways that are functionally closer to contemporary China than to the America of the Founding Fathers. In these respects, ‘Chimerica’ is no chimera. Once these economies seemed like opposites, with one doing the exporting, the other the importing, one doing the saving, the other the consuming.1 Since the financial crisis, however, there has been a certain convergence. Today the real estate bubble, the excessive leverage, the shadow banks – not to mention the technology ‘unicorns’ – are almost as likely to be encountered in China as in America. In Chimerica 1.0, opposites attracted. In Chimerica 2.0, the odd couple have become uncannily alike, as often happens in a marriage.

Easily centralized technology made totalitarian government possible in the 1930s. Forty years later, it had already got much harder for a democratically elected president to violate the law with impunity. Nevertheless, the media in the 1970s still consisted of a few television networks, newspapers and press agencies. And in more than half the world those organs were centrally controlled. It is impossible to comprehend the world today without understanding how much it has changed as a result of new information technology. This has become a truism. The crucial question is how has it changed? The answer is that technology has enormously empowered networks of all kinds relative to traditional hierarchical power structures – but that the consequences of that change will be determined by the structures, emergent properties and interactions of these networks.

In traditional societies, the advent of market forces disrupts often hereditary networks, and as a result promotes social mobility and reduces inequality. Meritocracy prevails. But when networks and markets are aligned, as in our time, inequality explodes as the returns on the network flow overwhelmingly to the insiders who own it. Granted, the young and very wealthy people who own the modern networks tend to have somewhat left-wing political views. (Peter Thiel is the rare exception: a libertarian who was willing to sup with the populists in 2016.) However, few of them would welcome Scandinavian rates of personal income tax, much less an egalitarian revolution. The masters of the Internet would seem to relish being rich almost as much as the wolves of pre-crisis Wall Street a decade ago, though their consumption is less conspicuous than their pangs of conscience are.

The near-autarkic, commanding and controlling states that emerged from the Depression, the Second World War and the early Cold War exist today, if at all, only as pale shadows of their former selves. The bureaucracies and party machines that ran them are defunct or in decay. The administrative state is their final incarnation. Today, the combination of technological innovation and international economic integration has created entirely new forms of network – ranging from the criminal underworld to the rarefied ‘overworld’ of Davos – that were scarcely dreamt of by Keynes, Kennan or Trevor-Roper.

At the Congress of Vienna, the five great powers agreed to establish such an order, and the pentarchy they formed provided a remarkable stability for the better part of the century that followed.

“How much truth is contained in something can be best determined by making it thoroughly laughable and then watching to see how much joking around it can take. For truth is a matter that can stand mockery, that is freshened by any ironic gesture directed at it. Whatever cannot stand satire is false.” —Peter Sloterdijk12

The contemporary progressive mantra considers it laudable to argue that different races, cultures, or religions possess distinct ways of knowing. However, not too long ago, the idea that people of different races or classes possessed distinct ways of thinking and reasoning, was reserved for racists and other miscreants. Ludwig von Mises, a leading figure of the Austrian School of Economics and a staunch defender of classical liberalism, coined the term polylogism to capture this exact folly. Mises differentiated between Marxian polylogism and racial polylogism. In the former case, an individual’s method of thinking was determined by his social class while in the latter case, race was the guiding factor.

A study of social and personality psychologists documented the paucity of conservative faculty members (only 6 percent of the surveyed sample).43 Of note, a sizeable number of faculty members admitted that they would discriminate against conservative colleagues when reviewing their papers or grant applications, when deciding whether to invite them to a symposium, and when making hiring decisions. The more “liberal” a faculty member was, the more likely he was to endorse this sort of brazen discrimination. Given the rampant discriminatory bias against them, is it any surprise that conservative students and professors feel unwelcome in the academy and that most conservative graduate students and faculty members are likely to hide their political leanings?

Of note, beyond industries that deal with information (academia, journalism, social media), there are many professions wherein a political tilt has tangible repercussions. For example, physicians are likely to offer different treatments as a function of their political leanings.49 To further complicate matters, different medical specialties yield varying patterns of political affiliations, the most conservative of which are surgery, anesthesiology, and urology, and the most liberal being infectious disease, psychiatry, and pediatrics.50 Choose your psychiatrist carefully lest your schizophrenia be blamed on climate change, an overbearing mother, or Donald Trump.

The building of this nomological network, composed of heterogeneous confirmatory cumulative evidence, is not, of course, an attack on individual Muslims. It is the application of a dispassionate epistemological approach to scrutinizing an ideology and establishing whether it promotes peace, pluralism, and liberty. The conclusion of this analysis is veridical even though the great majority of Muslims are undoubtedly kind and decent people. In a free society, people should be able to analyze such data without accusations of bigotry. That is how we come to the truth.

Another reason people are reluctant to join the battle of ideas is what we call “diffusion of responsibility” or “the bystander effect.” In the late 1960s, psychologists John Darley and Bibb Latané documented what at first glance seems counterintuitive. The greater the number of people present, the less likely an individual is to help someone in need because it is easier to rationalize that someone else will do it. It is easy to diffuse responsibility to others who are willing to stick their necks out:

Many people, of course, worry about straining friendships if they broach sensitive topics. But true friendships are precisely those that should withstand the stress of such conversations. A deep friendship should be antifragile (to use the concept of Nassim Taleb). The English historian Henry Thomas Buckle famously remarked: “Men and women range themselves into three classes or orders of intelligence; you can tell the lowest class by their habit of always talking about persons; the next by the fact that their habit is always to converse about things; the highest, by their preference for the discussion of ideas.”5 [Italics in original.] I would argue that a similar taxonomy captures the strength of a friendship: idle chatter is well suited for breaking the ice with strangers and engaging in banter with acquaintances; deep meaningful conversations about important ideas in politics and religion should be a central feature of any valuable friendship. If so-called friends are unable to accept a difference of opinion on a substantive issue, then they are unworthy of your friendship. Two poignant French sayings come to mind: 1) Mieux vaut être seul que mal accompagné [Best to be alone than poorly accompanied]; and 2) Dis-moi qui sont tes amis et je te dirai qui tu es [Tell me who your friends are, and I’ll tell you who you are]. Humans are a social species. We thrive emotionally and cognitively when we forge intense bonds of friendship. In the pursuit of happiness, we should strive to establish friendships with individuals with whom we can experience the full range of cerebral engagement. This can’t happen if we are too afraid to disagree with our close friends on consequential issues. Choose your friends wisely.

If I were to ask you to think about the people whom you consider to be most interesting, they would likely have one thing in common: they judge; they opine; they take positions. Fence-sitters who equivocate about the pros and cons of every conceivable issue without ever pronouncing a judgment are profoundly boring people. To never judge is to be an intellectual coward for it serves as an insurance policy against the possibility of being a polarizing figure. The most charismatic public intellectuals are typically those who share their judgments on a broad range of issues.

Short-term prediction. While the long-term view addresses business needs 90 days and beyond, short-term focuses on the immediate future. These are the issues that will arise on a daily or weekly basis, and your ability to solve them will affect the long-term greater good of the organization. As a leader in an organization, you’re probably hit with at least half a dozen problems a day. Most leaders are so buried in the day-to-day grind that they’ll typically think up flimsy workarounds just to get nagging issues out of their way so they can make it to the next week. If this happens long enough, their whole organization will come to be held together by duct tape and twine, and it will ultimately implode.

As China emulated America’s past successes, the US government got busy undermining its own strengths. A procedure-obsessed left conspired with a thoughtlessly destructive right to constrain the government. Neither the left nor the right allows the state to deliver essential goods expected by the public. The Biden administration may have ushered through historic bills on industrial policy, but executive agencies were so obsessed with procedural concerns that little building actually took place before voters reelected Donald Trump, who has threatened to cancel many of these projects. The United States is still a superpower that is able to outclass China on many dimensions.

The United States, by contrast, has a government of the lawyers, by the lawyers, and for the lawyers. Five out of the last ten presidents attended law school. In any given year, at least half the US Congress has law degrees, while at best a handful of members have studied science or engineering. From 1984 to 2020, every single Democratic presidential and vice-presidential nominee went to law school, but they make up many Republican Party elites as well as the top ranks of the civil service too. By contrast, only two American presidents worked as engineers: Herbert Hoover, who built a fortune in mining, and Jimmy Carter, who served as an engineering officer on a nuclear submarine.

Engineers go hard in one direction, and if they perceive something isn’t working, they switch with no loss of speed toward another. They don’t suffer criticism from humanist softies. Change in China can be so dramatic because so few voices are part of the political process. To a first approximation, the twenty-four men who make up the Political Bureau (the highest echelon of the Communist Party, usually shortened to Politburo) are the only people permitted to do politics. Once they’ve settled questions of strategy, the only remaining task is for the bureaucracy to sort out the details. But when it makes mistakes, it can drag nearly the entire population into crisis.

But the little pinks have a line of argument that tickles me. “Look at those Americans,” a few say, “who have no high-speed rail or gleaming skyscrapers like we do. Their only skill is blocking themselves, which they are now doing to us.” Little pinks are wrong to say that the United States is powerful enough to tank China’s economy; they’re not wrong that the United States blocks itself.

The latest estimate for California’s rail line is $128 billion. Why does it cost so much? Partly because some politicians have demanded that the train add a stop in their district, forcing the line to take a more tortuous route through an extra mountain range. And partly because California’s rail authority prefers to tout the number of high-paying jobs it is creating rather than the amount of track it has been laying.

More than any other group in the United States, lawyers are afforded license to be generalists, permitted to stomp into whichever intellectual realm pleases them. “American aristocracy,” wrote Alexis de Tocqueville, “is not composed of the rich . . . but occupies the judicial bench and the bar.” Lawyers have become even more powerful since Tocqueville wrote those words in 1833. In recent decades, lawyers have been able to muscle out economists even in economic policymaking. The Biden administration was staffed by many graduates of Yale Law, who were willing to ignore the logic of the invisible hand. Instead, they roll up their sleeves to perform surgery on the American economy, one case at a time, devising a subsidy scheme for one corporation or bringing an antitrust case against another. Lawyers create so many complications that the rules governing everything from health care and housing to banking have become incomprehensible.

It’s not just the government. America’s problem is the lawyerly society. The United States is unusual among Western countries for having so many lawyers: four hundred lawyers per hundred thousand people, which is three times higher than the average in European countries. Since lawyers are everywhere, proceduralism has reached everywhere, including universities and corporations. Anyone working in these today has seen how procedures become an end in themselves, such that people grow obsessed with their logic and forget about the outcome.

Xi Jinping has forcefully centered the political decision-making process on himself, demonstrating that he intends to rule the Communist Party for as long as he pleases. The American government, meanwhile, has been mired in ineffectualness. For decades, the American right connived to drown the government in a bathtub while the left was strangling it with rules and lawsuits.

By trying to get everything done all at once, they end up accomplishing very little and feeling frustrated. One client of mine was very stubborn about this point for the first two years. I would tell him to limit the company goals between three and seven, and each year we set goals, he would keep piling on more. When we were done, the company would have 12 to 15 goals for the year.

You can effectively communicate the company vision in three events: 1. Have a company kickoff meeting and unveil your clearly defined vision (the V/TO). This is an opportunity to share your newly created core value speech for the first time. Make sure to include question-and-answer time. 2. Every 90 days, have a short (no more than 45-minute) state-of-the-company meeting with all employees. The objective of this event is to share successes and progress, review the V/TO, and communicate newly set company Rocks for the quarter. The quarterly state-of-the-company has proven to be the most effective discipline for helping people share, understand, and buy into the company vision. In its purest form, the meeting has a three-part agenda. 1. Where you’ve been 2. Where you are 3. Where you are going Each quarter, you and your leadership team fill each of those agenda items with three of the most relevant data points, and you’ll deliver a clear, concise, and powerful message that keeps your people in the know.

Unfortunately, there has never been a crystal clear definition for what it actually means. As a result, it was another term among a complex mix of terminologies that only added to the confusion.

VISIONARIES The concept of the visionary within an Accountability Chart is one of my greatest discoveries. I’ve had clients teach this concept at universities to MBAs on my behalf. Understanding and implementing this concept is eye-opening and empowering. Frankly, it has also kept some partners from killing each other. The visionary and the integrator couldn’t be more different. In a small to mid-size company, the visionary is typically the owner, co-owner, or founder. In a partnership, most of the time, one partner is the visionary and the other is the integrator. It’s a dynamic that has elevated them to where they are. The visionary typically has 10 new ideas a week. Nine of them might not be so great, but one usually is, and it’s that one idea each week that keeps the organization growing. For this reason, visionaries are invaluable. They’re typically very creative. They’re great solvers of big ugly problems (not the little practical ones), and fantastic with important clients, vendors, suppliers, and banking relationships. The culture of the organization is very important to them, because they usually operate more on emotion and therefore have a better barometer of how people are feeling. If you’re one, know thyself and be free.

For the Data Component, you will be introduced to a time-tested tool that will allow you to quantify your company’s results. It’s called a Scorecard, and once you learn to use it, you’ll be able to accurately read the pulse of your business. With hard data in hand, you’ll sleep better at night. Ultimately, you will have the ability to let go of the vine and be better connected than ever. In addition, you will reach the point where everyone in your organization has a number, a meaningful, manageable measurable. This will give them clear direction and increase productivity.

According to an old business maxim, anything that is measured and watched is improved. The concept of managing through a Scorecard has been around for a long time. The idea has been expressed through many different terms. It’s been called a dashboard, flash report, scoreboard metrics, measurables, key performance indicators, smart numbers, and so on. Whatever you call it, it’s a handful of numbers that can tell you at a glance how your business is doing.

THREE SCORECARD RULES OF THUMB 1. The numbers in the Scorecard should be weekly activity-based numbers, not the type of high-level numbers you see in a profit and loss statement (P&L). Remember, this Scorecard is not a P&L. It’s based on numbers showing activity and telling you whether you’re on track for a strong P&L. In other words, your Scorecard predicts your P&L. What are activity-based numbers? To help clarify, let’s look at a couple of examples.

Has China already been practicing supply-side progressivism? No, because nothing about it is “progressive” in a way that someone on the American left would understand. China’s means of construction entail evicting people from their land, adopting a relatively lax approach to environmental protection and worker safety, and interpreting the public interest without substantial engagement with the actual people.

When I moved to China in 2017 to cover technology, it was still common to hear Americans say that Chinese companies couldn’t innovate. China could only copy and steal, they said. Some folks in Silicon Valley knew that there were cool things cooking in Shenzhen, but the broader attitude among Americans was condescension. When I left China in 2023, the tenor of American views had shifted. Fewer people were saying China hasn’t developed any important technologies, since it has become a major producer of electric vehicles and clean technologies.

The US manufacturing base has, with some exceptions, rusted from top to bottom. Why have so many manufacturers crumbled? Partly, I think, we can examine the culture of financial investors. Wall Street has been far keener to invest in capital-light businesses: digital platforms like social media and search engines or chip companies that focus on design rather than cumbersome fabrication facilities.

In retrospect, it is an indictment of the American financial system that fundraising for a manufacturing leader had to be this difficult. Financialization also intersects with corporate consolidation. One prominent line of argument regarding General Electric was that the company was taken over by finance. That applies in greater force against Boeing. Once run by engineers obsessed with safety and quality, its leadership shifted to executives more focused on delivering shareholder value than good planes.

When I worked in Silicon Valley, people liked to say that knowledge travels at the speed of beer. Engineers like to talk to each other to solve technical problems, which is how knowledge diffuses. They are poached by rival firms or sometimes rival countries. Over the longer run, it’s difficult for countries to monopolize their dominance over any technology. If such a thing were possible, then the United States would still be behind the United Kingdom or Germany, which were much greater scientific innovators.

State-affiliated researchers commonly denounce financialization with the hollowing out of manufacturing in the same breath.

At Moscow State University, Song was exposed to the thrilling new field of cybernetics. This mathematical discipline was one of several new fields, including operations research and computing, that grew from research produced during World War II. Norbert Wiener’s 1948 book Cybernetics became a hit, not because it was filled with equations but because of its intoxicating subtitle: Control and Communication in the Animal and Machine. Its central idea was to develop the mathematics to control complex systems by feeding the system’s outputs back into its algorithms as a continuous optimization. It is the study of regulation and control of technological or biological systems. Cybernetics has occupied an intellectual sweet spot: electrifying in its premise—attracting subordinate terms like “machine intelligence” and “systems analysis” that are irresistible in themselves—and constructed with an inherent vagueness that affords it the theoretical space to wriggle out of refutation. It is a concept that might go dormant but never completely falls out of fashion. The 1956 Dartmouth Conference coined the term artificial intelligence partly in reaction to cybernetics; Martin Heidegger claimed that philosophy was dying, and cybernetics would be its successor.

In any other setting, these calculations might have been brushed aside as an unserious exercise. But the time was the 1970s, when China’s top leadership didn’t need foreigners to tell them that the country was facing economic stresses. The place was Beijing, where Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun imagined that the Four Modernizations would save China, if only it followed the science. And the scientist was Song Jian, who was known and trusted by the political establishment. When Song assured China’s leadership that population trajectories could be as firmly controlled as missile trajectories, they listened.

Song’s authority fit with Deng’s goals to cast his new policies as a modernizing, scientific force, with the precisely drawn graphs to prove it. Deng and Chen Yun were starting to think about China’s growth in per-capita terms, which pushed them into the faulty line of thinking that resources per person were higher when there were fewer people. Years later, Song gloated about how much smarter natural scientists were than social scientists. His strategy, if he were ever attacked, was to “withdraw into the sanctuary with the high prestige of natural science.” Song never stopped congratulating himself. In a 1988 book, Population Systems Control, he and a coauthor wrote, “Using statistical and quantitative research methodologies, population studies have been freed from the interference of human emotions and the damaging effect of popular ethics.”

Song Jian’s home province of Shandong experienced the most notorious incident of strict enforcement. Zeng Zhaoqi, newly appointed party secretary of Guan County, was humiliated that it ranked last in the province for family planning. So he summoned the twenty-two most senior party officials one day in April, berating them for their failings and shouting that their measures must be more extraordinary. He demanded there be zero births in the county between May 1 to August 10. In reports now censored, residents said that every woman was forced to have an abortion, no matter how far she was into her pregnancy or whether it had been authorized. Zeng found toughs from other counties—since locals were reluctant to hurt their own—to halt births. This incident in Guan County is known by two names: the “childless hundred days” as well as the “slaughter of the lambs,” since 1991 was the year of the sheep in the Chinese zodiac.

Beijing took too long to end the one-child policy in large part due to bureaucratic inertia. The State Family Planning Commission had over 500,000 workers, 1.2 million local enforcers, and 6 million village officials engaged in enforcement. It collected $200 billion in fines over its lifetime, according to state media. For the millions of people given jobs by this bureaucracy, it was worthwhile to keep the policy from expiring. And the commission kept finding evidence that families were hiding their out-of-plan children. It wasn’t until the 2010 census conclusively proved the fertility rate had collapsed that the central government dissolved the commission.

Time has worn away some of the memories of the traumas. But they are still there for rural folks. Foreigners curious about the one-child policy will probably not hear vivid stories from the Chinese they speak to, who tend to be relatively privileged people from cities. It is rare for rural folks to be able to study and live abroad. They sometimes have a hard time even moving to cities, given the restrictions of the hukou system—another social engineering project—meant to restrict internal migration. The one-child policy is another reminder of a phrase that resonates a great deal for me: “Chinese peasants, your name is misery.” It was coined by Sun Dawu, a rural entrepreneur now jailed for his advocacy.

The lawyerly society debated the one-child policy and rejected it. The United States and other Western countries also considered implementing strict population controls in reaction to The Population Bomb. Social scientists, especially economists, were quick to criticize the flaws in these linear projections. But in China, social scientists had become meek from Mao’s bullying. At this critical moment, the country lacked the intellectual antibodies to resist the policy’s adoption. Chinese leaders were just enough exposed to the West to absorb this neo-Malthusian doomerism, without being exposed enough to the Western pushback against it.

Demographers give credit to Deng Xiaoping for driving down fertility not through the one-child policy but through economic reopening. Higher rates of urbanization, educational attainment, and, most of all, economic growth have been the best contraceptive measures devised by modernity. These were factors that drove neighboring Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan to lower their fertility rate too.

After moving from China to the Yale Law School, I gained some new perspectives. It was a good thing that the United States stumbled to “live with the virus.” I found one item particularly quite irksome on my return to America in 2023: a yard sign that begins “In this home we believe science is real.” The Communist Party “followed the science” of zero-Covid to its logical conclusion: barring people from their homes, testing people on a near-daily basis, and doing everything else it could to break the chains of transmission. Four decades ago, it “followed the science” to forcibly prevent many pregnancies in the pursuit of the one-child policy. We can agree that “science is real.” But we have to keep in mind that there is a political determination involved with how to interpret the science. And that is something the lawyerly society is better at. It has lawyers interested in protecting rights, economists able to think through social science, humanists who consider ethics, and many other voices in the mix, attempting to open policy prescriptions up for debate. China doesn’t have a robust system for political contestation; engineers will simply follow the science until it leads to social immiseration.

China takes energy security seriously. The enormous effort it has made to build low-carbon capacity—solar, wind, and nuclear—has to be understood as part of a broader motivation to make the country dependent on energy sources within its borders. Beijing is trying to mitigate the pain if it ever loses access to sea-lanes that deliver its oil. That is also why, in 2023, China added twenty times more coal-burning capacity than the rest of the world put together. It is serious about addressing issues in climate change, yes. But Beijing is not turning its back on its rich coal reserves. That also explains why China is so enthusiastic about electrifying the auto fleet: It would rather burn domestic coal than Middle East oil to power its cars.

Perhaps the lawyerly society will have the ideological resilience not to be seduced by artificial intelligence, while authoritarian countries wreck themselves by doing so. But it’s also possible that Western minds will be broken by AI. In the United States, every shift in mass media—from cable television in the 1990s, the internet in the 2000s, social media in the 2010s, and now AI—has increased discontent between the masses and the elites, as well as between the elites and each other. American society has become much messier than two decades ago, when people were bound by a consensual reality rather than spinning off into different worlds.

The United States could use fewer lawyers who devote their careers to litigating the life out of government agencies and more lawyers of the dealmaker bent who are interested in working out how to deliver better services. Law professor Nick Bagley concluded his seminal paper on proceduralism (which I referenced in the first chapter) with a polite, but deceptively powerful, proposition that I want to echo: Lawyers should consider whether they could achieve more by stepping out of the way.

How might change come? Perhaps through ordinary acts of resistance. China’s leaders have for millennia tried to impose greater controls on the people. And the people have developed their own strategies for dealing with this control. Though the state wants to see society as an engineering exercise, the reality of China—immediately apparent to those of us who have spent any time there—is that the country is messy. Daily life in China is far more disorderly than the images projected by state media, in which every village is immaculate and where everyone sits with a straight back as they listen to Xi’s pronouncements. Neither is the Communist Party staffed by a far-planning technocracy, nor is it able to squeeze as hard as it wants to achieve national security. People find ways to adapt around the most onerous demands of the engineers. They wield weapons of the weak. When folks see a flurry of senseless rules from the government, they might react with foot dragging, petty noncompliance, feigned ignorance, and arguing back. The system for negotiability is one reason that people have been able to accommodate themselves to engineers.

So why do their classmates envy my parents? Because they live a pleasant life without having to deal with the problems that attend the lives of even well-off Chinese citizens. The Chinese middle class is precariously exposed to changes in Beijing’s mood. Those in business have to deal with incredible stress, facing down threats from competitors or the local government. They have a gnawing sense that their lives are being shortened by the air they breathe or food they eat. And they feel deep uncertainties about their property values, the future of economic growth, or whether Beijing will visit some sort of disaster upon them or their companies.

No, not everyone has to live in the suburbs. But Americans do often have to choose between poorly governed cities or car-dependent suburbia. I wish that there were more spaces like Sunset Park: a relatively affordable neighborhood in a city connected by mass transit that enables people of different cultures to mix. For all of New York City’s flaws, it remains one of the few truly urban places in the United States, dense, walkable, with some degree of economic integration. But rather than continue to improve and modernize such places, as Robert Moses tried to do, we have left them in a weird, disconnected state while funneling the country’s abundant talent into creating new virtual worlds. Is that the trade Americans want?

What New York has lost since the 1960s are updates to its physical environment. The city is still relying on the infrastructure that came to a stop when the reign of Moses ended, which makes me think that there’s not much to be gained in stomping on Moses’s name still further. New York, and the United States writ large, cannot survive indefinitely on the infrastructure built nearly a century ago. There are always trade-offs and compromises inherent to building large-scale public works, and instead of vilifying the people from our past who made tough choices, we must confront these tough choices ourselves.

The American right, I hope, can remember that it is possible to build wonders using the government. In 2025, the tech right celebrates the achievements of Elon Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) seeks to shred the federal government. No one can dispute that the US government is capable of astonishing inefficiency, but it used to be able to deliver the technologically astonishing too. If the left can reckon with Robert Moses, the right should reckon with Admiral Hyman Rickover—an engineer who improved national security through a large-scale, government-led project.

This declaration is part of a cynical diplomatic effort to convince the poorer countries of the world that China stands for their interests. That’s not the appeal for me. Rather, I think it is wise for the country to declare that it is “developing.” The United States should do that too. Isn’t it better than to be a “developed” one, which implies that you’re done, finished, at the end of the road? Leave “developed” status, I say, to Europe’s beautiful mausoleum economy.

The United States should embrace its transformational urge. I hope one day that America can declare itself to be a developing country too.

I’ve written this book because the very thing that drew my parents to the United States—not lawyers, but pluralism—still provides the potential for course correction. The ultimate reason to be hopeful for the United States is that it can look to its own history to see the path forward. You can see the musculature of the engineering state amid the mighty industrial works scattered all over the country. There’s a natural legacy it has to draw on to stage this next act of transformation. What the United States presently lacks is the urgency to make the hard choices to build.

It’s human nature to put off making a hard decision. If given the option, most people would prefer not to address an issue and hope that it goes away on its own. This reluctance to act can be a drag on growth and is extremely frustrating to watch. As Napoleon Bonaparte said, “Nothing is more difficult and therefore more precious than to be able to decide.”

1. Identify 2. Discuss 3. Solve To start, you must first examine your Issues List and quickly decide on the top three issues to be solved. Do not make the mistake of starting at the top of your Issues List and working your way down. If the most important issue is seventh on the list, you will rarely handle that many issues in one sitting, and as a result you will not get to the most important one.

The faster you understand that, the better your odds are of staying sane. Solve the most important one first, and then move on to the next. 7. Thou Shalt Live with It, End It, or Change It This is another great lesson from my dad. In solving an issue, you have three options: You can either live with it, end it, or change it. There are no others. With this understanding, you must decide which of the three it’s going to be. If you can no longer live with the issue, you have two options: Change it or end it. If you don’t have the wherewithal to do those, then agree to live with it and stop complaining. Living with it should, however, be the last resort. 8. Thou Shalt Choose Short-Term Pain and Suffering Both long-term and short-term pain require suffering. Remember the “36 hours of pain” rule, and solve your problem now rather than later. 9. Thou Shalt Enter the Danger The issue that you fear the most is the one you most need to discuss and resolve. 10. Thou Shalt Take a Shot Taking a shot means that you should propose a solution. Don’t wait around for someone else to solve it. If you’re wrong, your team will let you know.

This logical view of the brain is absurd. It defies basic biology. It seems sensible only because it is repeated endlessly to us from the moment we set foot in school. We are brainwashed to believe it, to our own detriment. The path back to sanity begins by acknowledging that intelligence is more than logic enriched with generative bursts of randomness. Randomness is capricious and wasteful—while intelligence is purposeful and prudent. This is why the human brain is not random, as you can prove. Try to make a list of random numbers. You will go slowly and your numbers will clump nonrandomly. That doesn’t mean, however, that your neurons are running logic. Logic requires data, and in life, data is almost always in short supply. To handle the unstable dark of worldly existence, our brain had to develop mechanisms for acting smart with little, even no, information. Otherwise, intelligence would have been as useful as an empty spreadsheet.

Moreover, many of America’s leading thinkers on international affairs retain this heady sensibility, as if hoping the nation can will itself back to unipolarity, even as many ordinary Americans sense that things have changed profoundly.

A similar common problem is trying to document every single little detail down to the nth degree. This is overkill. You just need to capture the basic steps in the process, because the real problem is that people are skipping steps, and not always on purpose. Festering problems then blow up weeks or months down the road. In the heat of the uproar, you treat the symptom and not the root cause, which was that someone skipped a step. There is always an uncomfortable laugh when I share this truth. You need to document the steps in the process at a very high level, with several bullets under each step, which are procedures.

The mere existence of power in key regions is not what the United States should fear. Instead, it should care about the use of the power of these regions to materially impair America’s security, freedom, and prosperity. American concern should therefore focus on a state or states that could direct or marshal the power of one of these key regions. This is because no single state in the current environment—not even China, the world’s other most powerful state—possesses sufficient power on its own to plausibly coerce the United States over its fundamental purposes; only some conglomeration of other states could gather the power to do this. Thus the only way the United States could face a situation in which other states were substantially stronger than America over the issues it really cares about would be if the power of one or more of these key regions were agglomerated. The most plausible form by which a state could accumulate such power is hegemony, meaning that a state exercises authority over other states and extracts benefits from them, but without the responsibilities or risks of direct control. In this book I will use the term predominance interchangeably with hegemony.16 (Empire, the other way that states exercise control over other states, is much more costly because it requires direct administrative control by the imperial center.

The advantage of bandwagoning or accommodating an aspirant like China, by contrast, is that it avoids such risks. By joining with the aspirant or merely not contesting it, the bandwagoning state removes itself from the aspirant’s sights. Bandwagoning may also lead to rewards and preferential treatment. China, having such a large economy, has the ability to provide material inducements to bandwagoning states. It can also offer them a special place in the regional pecking order it seeks to establish. The cost of bandwagoning is that it can amount to a preemptive surrender of at least a portion of national autonomy, with no assurance that there will not be further loss if the aspirant achieves its goal. Moreover, it may expose the bandwagoning state to punishment by the anti-hegemonic coalition, which may also use violence as well as inducements to pursue its strategic aim of denial. This choice between balancing and bandwagoning is not binary but rather falls along a spectrum.

So, too, does the United States. The fundamental interest of the United States is in ensuring favorable regional balances of power so that it can deny any other state the ability to achieve hegemony over a key region. Critically, this does not necessarily dictate American involvement. America requires only that there be sufficient power and resolve whereby some state or coalition can defeat an aspiring hegemon such as China in a systemic regional war. Because of the enormous costs and risks of such a war, the United States has a very great interest in minimizing its involvement in such an effort—or avoiding it entirely.

These dynamics are familiar from everyday life. Anyone who has raised money for a company or an initiative knows the value of a cornerstone investor or donor, just as anyone who has put together a conference or event knows the value of engaging a big-name speaker early. Money, time, and effort are scarce, so people look to see who has already given their money or time to ensure that they are not wasting their own. When a big mover is involved, one can feel more confident that one’s money or time will not be wasted.

This is crucial because, again, the United States does not need to be directly engaged in generating or sustaining favorable balances of power in the key regions of the world. Indeed, all things being equal, it is better to avoid such engagement, which carries substantial costs and risks. As a general principle, then, the United States should look upon heavy, risky intervention in key regions with distinct skepticism. If a favorable balance of power denying an aspirant regional hegemony can be maintained without US involvement, so much the better. The United States should become directly and substantially engaged only if a favorable balance of power is unlikely to be maintained in a key region without it.

This criterion for US strategy also helps explain a puzzle left by the conventional narrative of American strategic history, which identifies the nation’s entry into the Second World War and its international leadership afterward as embodying a national shift from isolationism to internationalism. This account overlooks the United States’ long history of active engagement in Asia, which dates back at least to the occupation of the Philippines and the Open Door Policy, and even to the opening of Japan in the 1850s. A more parsimonious account explains US behavior as resulting from the increasing importance of its role in ensuring that no other state could dominate a region key to American interests, not from a wholesale transformation in the United States’ conception of its role in the world.

Considered solely in the transatlantic context, then, the United States is therefore better off if Europe is not a highly unified superstate for the same reasons that it should oppose establishment of a cohesive hegemony over any key region of the world. This does not mean that the United States should oppose any degree of European integration. It has an interest in a Europe that is reasonably stable and can act coherently on matters of mutual concern. A Europe with the ability to ease collective action challenges and help resolve disputes is in the interests of the United States. A confederated Europe can ameliorate instability and stave off conflicts within the continent that otherwise might draw in the United States; it can also act effectively in ways beneficial to American interests. But this does not mean the United States would benefit if the European Union or a successor became a truly unified entity capable of establishing regional hegemony and unduly burdening or even excluding US trade and engagement.

The prime variable that could modify this US interest is China. Because Asia is the world’s largest economic zone and China is the most serious potential regional hegemon, the US interest in Europe must be shaped by the requirements for ensuring that China does not establish predominance in Asia. If a disunified or even confederated Europe proves incapable of supporting or even indirectly enabling efforts to deny China hegemony in Asia, the US interest will tilt toward fostering a more cohesive Europe that aligns with the United States in checking China’s aspirations, even if it means some loss of leverage with respect to dealing with a unified Europe.

Accordingly, the prospects for anti-hegemonic coalitions in the world’s key regions should lead the United States to focus on acting as an external cornerstone balancer in Asia to ensure the formation and maintenance of a coalition against any Chinese bid for regional predominance. The United States should remain engaged in Europe to ensure a favorable regional balance of power, but in a considerably narrower and more concentrated way than in Asia, because of the absence of a plausible regional hegemon in Europe. In the Persian Gulf, the United States should focus on ensuring that the wealthy Gulf states do not fall under another state’s predominance, but this should not be difficult given the absence of any plausible regional hegemon. The rest of the world does not demand significant focus.

Alliances are especially relevant in this context because they are, in essence, promises to fight with or on behalf of others, especially when a state’s rationale for defending another state is not self-evident.4 The term alliance here refers to any relationship in which a state has committed to come to another’s defense; this commitment may be made and communicated through any number of methods, including formal treaties, but also other government statements, legislation, and patterns of behavior.

After the Second World War, the United States developed a hub-and-spoke alliance network in Asia, in which Washington allied with multiple states but those states were not generally allied with each other. This network proved sufficient during the Cold War. Japan and South Korea were both part of the US coalition but were not allied with each other; each was separately allied with Washington.9

US allies such as South Korea, Japan, and Australia may resist formally committing to the defense of Taiwan or the Philippines. They may judge that a US guarantee should be enough to keep such nervous states on side and that they can always choose to become involved later, for instance, through a coalition of the willing formed to deal with a particular contingency. This route preserves their flexibility and, they may hope, diminishes their exposure to Chinese ire. Last, political factors may inhibit the formation of new alliances or the linkage of existing ones, and such currents are very much alive in Asia.

How vulnerable states balance between these costs and benefits cannot be generalized as a rule. This is particularly because survival of a state as an independent entity does not obviously or universally supersede other goods. History is replete with examples of states that have compromised their autonomy and even their very existence as independent entities, such as Scotland in the early eighteenth century.15 How much a state is willing to sacrifice to protect such high goods is a preference that is shaped by many factors but is finally a reflection of how much the state’s people, and especially its decision-makers, value their freedom and autonomy. Some may see purple as the noblest winding sheet, others that survival is preferable to liberty.

Credibility is a universal factor in human life. It is an essential part of social interaction whenever a party pledges future action, especially when that promise entails exposing itself or its resources to harm or loss. This is as true in the international arena as it is in private life. The simple reason is that one cannot know with certainty how another will act. No state can have perfect confidence when trying to anticipate another state’s future decisions. Even decision-makers within a state cannot know exactly how their state will behave, just as individuals cannot know with certainty what decisions they will make in the future. Because of this uncertainty, states seek formal commitments from other states so that the risking state can avoid having to rely, when they are putting a great deal on the line, solely on speculative assessments of another state’s interests.

Why did that happen the way it did? Why did it happen at all? When Operators storythink about the future, they imagine events that could happen, asking what if. What if I try this?

To extricate yourself from the quit, push your mental gaze toward the long view—your narrative horizon—by remembering your overall strategy, the big life purpose that holds your past together.

And it’s more likely to work when executed assertively. I see this not just with Operators but with firefighters and paramedics. They tell me: “When crises happen, you have to act fast. If your team isn’t acting fast enough, you’ve got to get angry to make them hear.” “I use anger to fuel myself in critical situations. It makes me commit my hardest.” “Anger is intensity. It focuses the mind and energizes the body to work.”

Rather than getting aggressive, the smarter approach is to treat anger as a signal to pause and develop operational flexibility. Perhaps you’ve fallen into the optimization trap, believing that there’s one ideal fix for every situation. Or perhaps you’re stuck in a one-track mode of communication, such that when people don’t understand what you’re telling them, you simply repeat yourself more loudly. Or perhaps you’re experiencing stress. Stress ranges in intensity, but in all its forms, it stimulates a fright-or-fight response. When that response hits, your brain does a quick gut check: Do I have a plan that I believe can work? If the answer is no, your brain enters fear. If the answer is yes, your brain enters anger, executing the plan as forcefully as it can.

For an Emotion Reset to work quickly and reliably, it must be vividly specific. So prepare your Reset in advance—prepare it now—by reviewing your past for a time when you shifted your plans, adapting to life before you got trapped.
