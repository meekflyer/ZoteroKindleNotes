This chapter examines the key drivers of UK military operations since the end of the cold war by assessing how the UK has put strategy and doctrine into practice. The Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010 established seven military tasks for the UK armed forces ranging from the defence of the United Kingdom, deterrence of threats, and support for partners through defence engagement, to defence of the overseas territories. However, the review revealed a fundamental tension between ends, ways, and means, a tension also evident in SDSR 2015. The UK’s armed forces are also in transition, shifting away from the land-centric operations of the wars of Yugoslav succession of the mid-1990s to a greater focus on maritime–amphibious operations with an emphasis on deep ‘jointness’ (cross-service cooperation).","2018-07-19","2023-04-25 17:19:02","2023-09-28 22:08:29","2023-04-25 17:19:02","","","","1","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/C9L3QA9U/0425 Lindly-French - UK Military Ops.pdf","","NS3710; Britain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this review, we discuss the connection between Warburg effects and tumorigenesis, as well as adaptive responses to environment such as circadian rhythms on molecular pathways involved in metabolism. We also review the central role of the sirtuin family of proteins in physiological modulation of cellular processes and age-associated metabolic diseases. We also provide a macroscopic view of how the circadian rhythm affects metabolism and may be involved in cell metabolism reprogramming and cancer pathogenesis. The aberrations in metabolism and the circadian system may lead to age-associated diseases directly or through intermediates. These intermediates may be either mutated or reprogrammed, thus becoming responsible for chromatin modification and oncogene transcription. Integration of circadian rhythm and metabolic reprogramming in the holistic understanding of metabolic diseases and cancer may provide additional insights into human diseases.","2017","2020-03-17 19:48:19","2020-03-17 19:48:19","2020-03-17 19:48:19","314","","3","8","","Aging and disease","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/3DA9WDVB/Cao and Wang - 2017 - Associations among Metabolism, Circadian Rhythm an.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background:There are only a few studies reporting the work of electricians and even fewer approaching work organization. Moreover, these investigations often do not consider human physiological limitations and capabilities as well as task demands. Method: A new work system was proposed with consideration of (a) the circadian cycles and homeostatic processes; (b) the effect of heat, which is a zeitgeber (synchronizer) for the biological clocks; and (c) the degree of physical and mental demands of the different performed tasks, which was assessed on the basis of opinions of the electricians and physiological markers of stress that are controlled by circadian rhythms. The traditional and new systems were compared on the basis of two cognitive indices (the arrangement of matchsticks and the perception of a minute) and three physiological markers of mental-to-physical loads (heart frequency and the level of adrenaline and noradrenaline). Results: Both physical and mental loads were reduced in the new system. Conclusion: Work organization should include consideration of human circadian rhythms, mainly when stressful and high-risk tasks are involved.","2013-02","2020-03-17 19:48:15","2020-03-17 19:48:15","2020-03-17 19:48:15","204-217","","1","55","","Hum Factors","Circadian Rhythms as a Basis for Work Organization","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/W4HAAH8W/Guimarães et al. - 2013 - Circadian Rhythms as a Basis for Work Organization.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A growing number of programs and strategies provided by the military and civilian sectors are available to encourage and support psychological resilience to stress for service members and families. Though previous research from the field of psychology delineating the factors that foster psychological resilience is available, there has been no assessment of whether and how well the current military resilience programs are addressing these factors in their activities. Further, little is known about the effectiveness of these programs on developing resilience. To assist the Department of Defense in understanding methodologies that could be useful in promoting resilience among service members and their families, the authors conducted a focused literature review to identify evidence-informed factors for promoting psychological resilience. The study also reviewed a subset of military resilience programs to determine the extent to which they included those evidence-informed factors.

It's not simply that the workload is heavy and the demands are high. It's that too many students lack efficient methods to let them do their best. Professor Zachary Shore aims to change this. With humorous, lively prose, Professor Shore teaches you to master the five most crucial skills you need to succeed: how to read, write, speak, act, and research at a higher level.

A supplemental approach recognizes that regime change can be cyclic, not just progressive, regressive, or random. In fact, regime cycles are much of what we see in the postcommunist world, where some states have oscillated from autocracy toward greater democracy, then back toward more autocracy, and, with recent “colored revolutions,” toward greater democracy again. An institutional logic of elite collective action, focusing on the effects of               patronalpresidentialism,               is shown to be useful in understanding such cyclic dynamics, explaining why “revolutions” occurred between 2003 and 2005 in Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan but not in countries like Russia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan.","2005-10","2023-04-30 08:13:40","2024-05-15 21:04:28","2023-04-30 08:13:40","133-165","","1","58","","World Pol.","Regime Cycles","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/3RDA8SMB/Hale2005 - Regime cycles- democracy, autocracy, and revolution in post-Soviet Eurasia.pdf","","Russia; NS3401; Russia - Democracy; Russia - Putin Regime; supplemental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It reflects the unique perspective of an insider who is also recognized as a leading expert on this troubled relationship. American presidents have repeatedly attempted to forge a strong and productive partnership only to be held hostage to the deep mistrust born of the Cold War. For the United States, Russia remains a priority because of its nuclear weapons arsenal, its strategic location bordering Europe and Asia, and its ability to support--or thwart--American interests. Why has it been so difficult to move the relationship forward? What are the prospects for doing so in the future? Is the effort doomed to fail again and again?Angela Stent served as an adviser on Russia under Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and maintains close ties with key policymakers in both countries. Here, she argues that the same contentious issues--terrorism, missile defense, Iran, nuclear proliferation, Afghanistan, the former Soviet space, the greater Middle East--have been in every president's inbox, Democrat and Republican alike, since the collapse of the USSR. Stent vividly describes how Clinton and Bush sought inroads with Russia and staked much on their personal ties to Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin--only to leave office with relations at a low point--and how Barack Obama managed to restore ties only to see them undermined by a Putin regime resentful of American dominance and determined to restore Russia's great power status.The Limits of Partnership calls for a fundamental reassessment of the principles and practices that drive U.S.-Russian relations, and offers a path forward to meet the urgent challenges facing both countries""--","2014","2023-08-24 19:28:39","2023-08-24 19:29:04","","","355","","","","","The limits of partnership","","","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton, New Jersey","en","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","E183.8.R9 S836 2014","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/MLYWQZQM/Stent - 2014 - The limits of partnership U.S.-Russian relations .pdf","","Russia; NS3401; Russia - Threat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on his image of an indispensable strongman, reversing Russia’s catastrophic post-Soviet decline, Putin’s popularity allowed him to consolidate an authoritarian regime largely through the ballot box and with minimal resort to coercion. But this strongman appeal faded as Russia began to stagnate under his reign. The chapter analyzes how Putin resuscitated his decaying brand with the interventions in Ukraine and Syria, and why he cannot back down from his dangerous crusade to “make Russia great again.”","2020-05-07","2023-08-24 01:36:16","2023-08-24 01:36:54","2023-08-24 01:36:16","217-249","","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/3JHL69X9/Matovski - 2020 - The Logic of Vladimir Putin’s Popular Appeal.pdf","","Russia; NS3401; Russia - Democracy; Russia - Putin Regime","","","","","","","Matovski, Aleksandar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This book documents the widespread use of blatant and excessive manipulation of elections and explains what drives this practice. Alberto Simpser shows that, in many instances, elections are about more than winning. Electoral manipulation is not only a tool used to gain votes, but also a means of transmitting or distorting information. This manipulation conveys an image of strength, shaping the behavior of citizens, bureaucrats, politicians, parties, unions and businesspeople to the benefit of the manipulators, increasing the scope for the manipulators to pursue their goals while in government and mitigating future challenges to their hold on power. Why Governments and Parties Manipulate Elections provides a general theory about what drives electoral manipulation and empirically documents global patterns of manipulation.","2013-03-18","2023-05-02 01:02:02","2023-08-24 01:31:59","2023-05-02 01:02:02","","","","","","","Why Governments and Parties Manipulate Elections","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/8F387XSD/Simpser - 2013 - Why Governments and Parties Manipulate Elections .pdf","","Russia; NS3401; Russia - Putin Regime","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on a cross-national analysis of 132 countries and a detailed examination of the informal institutions of official graft in Ukraine, the article finds that where graft is systematically tracked, monitored, and granted by state leaders as an informal payment in exchange for compliance, it provides both an added incentive to obey leaders' directives and the potent sanction of criminal prosecution in the event of disobedience. Where graft is informally institutionalized in this way, it provides the basis for state organizations that are effective at collecting taxes, maintaining public order, and repressing political opposition but that may undermine the development of liberal politics.","2008-03","2023-04-25 03:47:51","2023-08-23 23:51:11","2023-04-25 03:47:51","35-59","","1","36","","Politics & Society","The Integrity of Corrupt States","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/2HT569HM/0425 Darden - The Integrity of Corrupt States.pdf","","Russia; Russia - Putin Regime; Russia - Corruption","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In their place, a new business elite has sprung up, most from the network of security service and law enforcement veterans known as the siloviki (roughly, ‘‘power agents’’) who form the backbone of President Putin’s administration. Indeed, the security forces’ takeover of corporate boardrooms is coming to deﬁne Putin’s regime. Silovarchs can deploy intelligence networks, state prosecutors, and armed force to intimidate or expropriate business rivals. Their temptation to use secret service tools and techniques predisposes the regime toward authoritarian politics. Western policy towards Russia will have to recognize these realities. The most promising path toward authentic democracy in Russia involves the cooptation of leading siloviki into the international business world.","2007-12","2023-04-20 00:21:20","2023-08-23 23:50:18","2023-04-20 00:21:20","141-153","","1","51","","Orbis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/LNDHRP53/0420 Treisman - Putin’s Silovarchs.pdf","","Russia; NS3401; Russia - Putin Regime","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The second is the administrative regime, which has emerged as a tutelary order standing outside the normative state although not repudiating its principles.

Yet the context of interaction, perceptions, and strategies is also important. Issues are linked to one another through multilevel games, which may be compatible or incompatible. Whether reciprocity constitutes an effective strategy depends both on linkages among issues and on the institutions within which negotiations take place. Perceptions are always significant and often decisive. Decision makers often actively seek to change the contexts within which they act by linking issues, trying to alter others' perceptions, establishing institutions, and promoting new norms. This finding suggests the importance of linking the upward-looking theory of strategy with the downward-looking theory of regimes.","1985-10","2023-04-12 17:47:16","2023-07-15 20:27:09","2023-04-12 17:47:16","226-254","","1","38","","World Pol.","Achieving Cooperation under Anarchy","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/37GKGJDA/Axelrod and Keohane - Achieving Cooperation Under Anarchy.pdf","","NS3024; international relations; neoliberal institutionalism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Surprisingly, however, these scholars have devoted little attention to the concept that boasts the most venerable tradition in the field of political science, that of political culture, as a possible source of state behavior. This neglect is unjustified. Like other cultural variables, political culture promises to explain phenomena that are enigmatic from the perspective of leading noncultural theories, such as neorealism. Yet it applies to a broader range of cases than do the many alternative cultural concepts, such as strategic culture and organizational culture, that have been employed. I begin by describing an important puzzle in the international relations literature that suggests the need to consider culture as a variable: the failure of neorealism to predict German security policy after unification. I then assess the various cultural approaches used in recent years to explain state behavior. After noting the similarities in these approaches, I discuss the important differences that mark them and identify the reasons for the greater utility of political culture. Finally, I illustrate the explanatory power of the political culture approach by applying it to the case of German security policy since 1990.","1999","2023-06-11 01:34:24","2023-06-11 01:34:24","2023-06-11 01:34:24","765-803","","4","53","","Int Org","Political Culture and State Behavior","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/VAPGEIPN/Duffield - 1999 - Political Culture and State Behavior Why Germany .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Technology has categorically reversed the information balance of power between the public and the elites who manage the great hierarchical institutions of the industrial age--government, political parties, the media. The Revolt of the Public tells the story of how insurgencies, enabled by digital devices and a vast information sphere, have mobilized millions of ordinary people around the world. Originally published in 2014, this updated edition of The Revolt of the Public includes an extensive analysis of Donald Trump's improbable rise to the presidency and the electoral triumphs of ""Brexit"" and concludes with a speculative look forward, pondering whether the current elite class can bring about a reformation of the democratic process, and whether new organizing principles, adapted to a digital world, can arise out of the present political turbulence. -- publisher's website","2018","2023-06-10 23:31:12","2023-12-04 23:55:34","","","445","","","","","","","","","","Stripe Press","San Francisco, CA","","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","HM851 .G87 2018","OCLC: on1081335036","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Second edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article aims to make a threefold contribution to the current debate on populism in liberal democracies. First, a clear and new definition of populism is presented. Second, the normal-pathology thesis is rejected; instead it is argued that today populist discourse has become mainstream in the politics of western democracies. Indeed, one can even speak of a populist Zeitgeist. Third, it is argued that the explanations of and reactions to the current populist Zeitgeist are seriously flawed and might actually strengthen rather than weaken it.","2004","2023-06-10 05:27:05","2023-06-10 05:27:05","2023-06-10 05:27:05","541-563","","4","39","","Gov. & oppos.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/M6TSL4YZ/Mudde - 2004 - The Populist Zeitgeist.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating both human expertise and GPT-4 classifications. Our findings reveal that around 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56% of all tasks.

The resulting mistakes can be valuable, the story goes, because we learn from them. But do we? Historian Zachary Shore says no, not always, and he has a long list of examples to prove his point. From colonialism to globalization, from gender wars to civil wars, or any circumstance for which our best solutions backfire, Shore demonstrates how rigid thinking can subtly lead us to undermine ourselves. In the process, he identifies seven ""cognition traps"" to avoid. But he also emphasizes how understanding these seven simple cognition traps can help us all make wiser judgments in our daily lives. For anyone whose best-laid plans have been foiled by faulty thinking, Blunder shines the penetrating spotlight of history on decision making and the patterns of thought that can lead us all astray.--From publisher description","2008","2023-09-25 17:27:46","2023-12-19 06:17:45","","","260","","","","","Blunder","","","","","Bloomsbury","New York","English","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","BF448 .S45 2008","OCLC: ocn225532324","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/C3TES4HJ/Blunder - Shore (2008).epub; /Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/ULSD9YJK/Blunder - Shore (2008).pdf","","NS4052","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1st U.S. Edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A great deal has been written about the personality and policies of Ho Chi Minh, but Le Duan's powerful influence on strategy has been largely overlooked. The article covers Le Duan's background and rise to power as the VWP First Secretary, as well as his strategic thinking about the United States from the 1950s through the deployment of U.S. ground troops in 1965. Although other VWP leaders influenced wartime strategy, Le Duan as First Secretary carried the greatest weight within the Politburo and exerted the strongest influence over the southern Communists, who were pivotal in fighting both U.S. and South Vietnamese forces. In his role as head of the southern Communists Le Duan developed strategies for defeating the United States and then implemented them as his power grew. The article spotlights several recurrent themes in his thinking: the nature of a protracted war, the role of casualties, and U.S. global standing. Each of these subjects influenced how the North Vietnamese intended to defeat the United States over the long term and offers insights into how Hanoi understood its enemy.","2015-10","2023-09-25 17:27:49","2023-12-19 06:32:13","2023-08-30 21:49:02","86-108","","4","17","","Journal of Cold War Studies","Provoking America","","","","","","","English","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Number: 4","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/5AYSJR6A/Provoking America - Shore (2015).pdf","","NS4052; Vietnam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It drives the headlines that surround us and the laws that touch our lives. From Machiavelli to Hobbes, Freud to Dawkins, the roots of this belief have sunk deep into Western thought. Human beings, we're taught, are by nature selfish and governed by self-interest. Humankind makes a new argument: that it is realistic, as well as revolutionary, to assume that people are good. The instinct to cooperate rather than compete, trust rather than distrust, has an evolutionary basis going right back to the beginning of Homo sapiens. By thinking the worst of others, we bring out the worst in our politics and economics too. In this major book, internationally bestselling author Rutger Bregman takes some of the world's most famous studies and events and reframes them, providing a new perspective on the last 200,000 years of human history. From the real-life Lord of the Flies to the Blitz, a Siberian fox farm to an infamous New York murder, Stanley Milgram's Yale shock machine to the Stanford prison experiment, Bregman shows how believing in human kindness and altruism can be a new way to think - and act as the foundation for achieving true change in our society.

This book brings together their most important intelligence reports on Nazi Germany, most of them published here for the first time. These reports provide a fresh perspective on Adolf Hitler's regime and the Second World War, and a fascinating window on Frankfurt School critical theory. They develop a detailed analysis of Nazism as a social and economic system and the role of anti-Semitism in Nazism, as well as a coherent plan for the reconstruction of postwar Germany as a democratic political system with a socialist economy. These reports played a significant role in the development of postwar Allied policy, including denazification and the preparation of the Nuremberg Trials. They also reveal how wartime intelligence analysis shaped the intellectual agendas of these three important German–Jewish scholars who fled Nazi persecution prior to the war. The book features a foreword and a comprehensive general introduction that puts these writings in historical and intellectual context.","2013-07-14","2023-09-25 17:27:58","2024-01-03 20:34:22","2023-09-23 16:04:04","","","","","","","Secret Reports on Nazi Germany","","","","","Princeton University Press","","English","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/R6M3U58E/Neumann et al. - 2013 - Secret Reports on Nazi Germany The Frankfurt Scho.pdf","","Germany; NS4052; World War 2; Knowing Your Enemy; model; intelligence","","Laudani, Raffaele","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nguyen Cong Luan was born and raised in small villages near Ha Noi. He grew up knowing war at the hands of the Japanese, the French, and the Viet Minh. Living with wars of conquest, colonialism, and revolution led him finally to move south and take up the cause of the Republic of Viet Nam, exchanging a life of victimhood for one of a soldier. His stories of village life in the north are every bit as compelling as his stories of combat and the tragedies of war. This honest and impassioned account is filled with the everyday heroism of the common people of his generation.","2012","2023-09-25 17:28:02","2023-12-19 06:28:33","2023-09-24 17:56:24","","","","","","","Nationalist in the Viet Nam Wars","","","","","Indiana University Press","Bloomington","English","","","","","Project MUSE","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/5P8IGRXK/Nationalist in the Viet Nam Wars - Nguyen Công Luan (2012).epub; /Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/2ADJR7XY/Nationalist in the Viet Nam Wars - Nguyen Cong Luan.pdf","","NS4052; Vietnam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The murder horrified quiet, complacent, prosperous Holland, a country that prides itself on being a bastion of tolerance, and sent shock waves across Europe and around the world. Ian Buruma returned to his native Netherlands to try to make sense of it all and to see what larger meaning should and shouldn't be drawn from this story.

"UYRGUQZT","book","2019","Sayle, Timothy A.","Enduring Alliance: A History of NATO and the Postwar Global Order","","978-1-5017-3550-9","","","","Born from necessity, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has always seemed on the verge of collapse. Even now, some seventy years after its inception, some consider its foundation uncertain and its structure weak. At this moment of incipient strategic crisis, Timothy A. Sayle offers a sweeping history of the most critical alliance in the post-World War II era. In Enduring Alliance, Sayle recounts how the western European powers, along with the United States and Canada, developed a treaty to prevent encroachments by the Soviet Union and to serve as a first defense in any future military conflict. As the growing and unruly hodgepodge of countries, councils, commands, and committees inflated NATO during the Cold War, Sayle shows that the work of executive leaders, high-level diplomats, and institutional functionaries within NATO kept the alliance alive and strong in the face of changing administrations, various crises, and the flux of geopolitical maneuverings. Resilience and flexibility have been the true hallmarks of NATO. As Enduring Alliance deftly shows, the history of NATO is organized around the balance of power, preponderant military forces, and plans for nuclear war. But it is also the history riven by generational change, the introduction of new approaches to conceiving international affairs, and the difficulty of diplomacy for democracies. As NATO celebrates its seventieth anniversary, the alliance once again faces challenges to its very existence even as it maintains its place firmly at the center of western hemisphere and global affairs","2019","2023-09-28 22:53:05","2024-05-18 23:02:10","","","346","","","","","Enduring alliance","","","","","Cornell University Press","Ithaca London","eng","","","","","K10plus ISBN","","","","","","NS3710; European Institutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As part of this ‘crisis’, the male domination of democracy – both in terms of its institutions and who participates – has been identified as problematic, even emblematic, of a more generalized democratic crisis. Increasing the participation of women is advocated as one solution. Using examples drawn from both long-standing and newer democracies (parliamentary and presidential), particularly from Europe and Latin America, this article explores the gender dynamics of the ‘crisis of democracy’. The ‘crisis’ has two gendered aspects. First, and paradoxically, although democracy still privileges predominantly white, elite, heterosexual, men, more women now participate in democratic institutions, leading to claims that the ‘male monopoly’ has ended (Dahlerup and Leyenaar 2013). Second, the ‘crisis of democracy’ may provide opportunities to further enhance women’s participation, as the demands of those favouring greater gender equality and those looking for solutions to the ‘crisis’ appear to coincide.","2015-07","2023-10-04 20:26:17","2023-10-11 20:23:14","2023-10-04 20:26:17","495-520","","3","50","","Gov. & oppos.","Engendering the ‘Crisis of Democracy’","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/6HQDVJSH/Waylen - 2015 - Engendering the ‘Crisis of Democracy’ Institution.pdf","","Democracy; NS3023; Gender; feminism; liberalism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It includes classic works, such as “Why Is There No International Theory?” and “Western Values in International Relations,” as well as previously unpublished works such as “The Communist Theory of International Relations” and “Gain, Fear and Glory: Reflections on the Nature of International Politics.” These works encompass four categories: (a) traditions of thinking about international politics since the sixteenth century, (b) the causes and functions of war, (c) international and regime legitimacy, and (d) fortune and irony in international politics. Wight identifies and analyzes three major traditions of thinking about international politics in the West since the sixteenth century: Realism, Rationalism, and Revolutionism, also known as the Machiavellian, Grotian, and Kantian approaches. Wight examines the causes of war highlighted by Thucydides and Hobbes (material interest, fear, and reputation), and considers the functions of war in international politics (such as winning and retaining national independence and upholding the balance of power). Wight reviews the history of dynastic and popular legitimacy as well as post-1945 concepts of international and domestic legitimacy. Finally, Wight considers fortune and irony, including the decision-maker’s frequent rediscovery of the recalcitrance of events. Unintended, unexpected, and ironical consequences abound in international politics. This volume also features eight book reviews by Wight, including his assessments of works by Raymond Aron, E. H.

It is one thing to know how to digitize; it is quite another to understand what digitization means strategically. The author maintains that, although the technical and tactical literature on cyber is abundant, strategic theoretical treatment is poor. He offers four conclusions: (1) cyber power will prove useful as an enabler of joint military operations; (2) cyber offense is likely to achieve some success, and the harm we suffer is most unlikely to be close to lethally damaging; (3) cyber power is only information and is only one way in which we collect, store, and transmit information; and, (4) it is clear enough today that the sky is not falling because of cyber peril. As a constructed environment, cyberspace is very much what we choose to make it. Once we shed our inappropriate awe of the scientific and technological novelty and wonder of it all, we ought to have little trouble realizing that as a strategic challenge we have met and succeeded against the like of networked computers and their electrons before.

This article explores some traditional notions of deterrence that must be remembered and reinvigorated, and notes aspects peculiar to cyber that must also be explored. Traditional deterrence makes clear the importance of promises and the difficulty in telling what the other side values and fears, and how it sees the world. Cyber conflict poses special problems in the uncertainties and ambiguities involved in, and related to the lack of shared understandings about what would constitute escalation.","","2023-10-11 18:37:30","2024-11-06 06:58:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/99BPER6Q/Jervis - Some Thoughts on Deterrence in the Cyber Era.pdf","","Cyber; CY4410; strategy; Deterrence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"857DJ6GC","journalArticle","","Ekiert, Grzegorz","The Illiberal Challenge in Post-Communist Europe","","","","","","Since the collapse of communist regimes in 1989, experts on the region have worried about the depth of popular support for democracy, a market economy, and liberal ideas. Radical movements and revolts against the neo-liberal reforms were widely expected. While states in Central and Eastern Europe have experienced long and costly transitions away from communism and the resulting economic and social dislocations were some of the most severe in the twentieth century, the popular revolt against liberal economic policies never materialized. The current financial and sovereign debt crisis puts renewed strain on economies in the region and forces austerity policies that again raise the specter of political extremism. Yet, despite such economic adversities and costs, political mobilization around illiberal ideas and against democracy and markets has been surprisingly marginal. This essay suggests that illiberal movements are gaining ground only in countries where they are supported by authoritarian states and in periods when illiberal political parties are in power. Thus, economic fortune alone does not seem to drive antiliberal political mobilization.","","2023-10-11 21:25:37","2023-10-11 21:28:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/3VTKAR2N/Ekiert - The Illiberal Challenge in Post-Communist Europe.pdf","","NS3023; Communism; 5class","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet it is China rather than Russia that has embraced globalization and developed trade and manufacturing, exporting increasingly higher-value-added goods. The explanation for this surprising outcome in found is Chinese elites viewing globalization as their best opportunity to catch up and overtake developed nations, while Russian elites are far more guarded in their acceptance of integration.

Two approaches are used to show when and why this dilemma operates less strongly and cooperation is more likely. First, the model of the Prisoner's Dilemma is used to demonstrate that cooperation is more likely when the costs of being exploited and the gains of exploiting others are low, when the gains from mutual cooperation and the costs of mutual noncooperation are high, and when each side expects the other to cooperate. Second, the security dilemma is ameliorated when the defense has the advantage over the offense and when defensive postures differ from offensive ones.

But existing cross-national empirical tests typically use measures of ethnolinguistic fractionalization (ELF) that have no information about substantive differences between groups. This article examines two important ways that groups differ from each other—culturally and economically—and assesses how such differences affect public goods provision. Across 46 countries, the analysis compares existing measures of cultural differences with a new measure that captures economic differences between groups: between-group inequality (BGI). We show that ELF, cultural fractionalization (CF), and BGI measure different things, and that the choice between them has an important impact on our understanding of which countries are most ethnically diverse. Furthermore, empirical tests reveal that BGI has a large, robust, and negative relationship with public goods provision, whereas CF, ELF, and overall inequality do not.","2010-11","2023-10-16 18:20:04","2023-10-16 18:27:15","2023-10-16 18:20:04","644-662","","4","104","","Am Polit Sci Rev","Economic versus Cultural Differences","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/TVDXZ4LL/Baldwin and Huber - 2010 - Economic versus Cultural Differences Forms of Eth.pdf","","NS3023; political culture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was precarious for most of history, which encouraged heavy emphasis on group solidarity, rejection of outsiders, and obedience to strong leaders. For under extreme scarcity, xenophobia is realistic: if there is just enough land to support one tribe and another tribe tries to claim it, survival may literally be a choice between us and them. Conversely, high levels of existential security encourage openness to change, diversity, and new ideas. The unprecedented prosperity and security of the postwar era brought cultural change, the environmentalist movement, and the spread of democracy. But in recent decades, diminishing job security and rising inequality have led to an authoritarian reaction. Evidence from more than 100 countries demonstrates that people's motivations and behavior reflect the extent to which they take survival for granted - and that modernization changes them in roughly predictable ways. This book explains the rise of environmentalist parties, gender equality, and same-sex marriage through a new, empirically-tested version of modernization theory","2018","2023-10-16 18:26:15","2023-10-16 18:26:40","","","","","","","","Cultural evolution","","","","","Cambridge University press","Cambridge, United Kingdom New York, NY","eng","","","","","BnF ISBN","303.4","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/EQG6TTPG/Inglehart 2018 - Ch 7 - Development and Democracy - optimized.pdf","","NS3023; culture; political culture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas scholars have examined primarily the relationship between individual inequality and conflict, we argue that horizontal inequalities between politically relevant ethnic groups and states at large can promote ethnonationalist conflict. Extending the empirical scope to the entire world, this article introduces a new spatial method that combines our newly geocoded data on ethnic groups’ settlement areas with spatial wealth estimates. Based on these methodological advances, we find that, in highly unequal societies, both rich and poor groups fight more often than those groups whose wealth lies closer to the country average. Our results remain robust to a number of alternative sample definitions and specifications.","2011-08","2023-10-17 19:42:01","2023-10-17 19:42:10","2023-10-17 19:42:01","478-495","","3","105","","Am Polit Sci Rev","Horizontal Inequalities and Ethnonationalist Civil War","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/CCNGBGKY/Cederman et al. - 2011 - Horizontal Inequalities and Ethnonationalist Civil.pdf","","NS3023; nations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Policies were poor: high export taxation and inefficient public service delivery, and “destiny” was adverse: landlocked, tropical locations, and terms of trade deterioration. During the 1990s, Africa's economic policies improved, although with considerable variation both between countries and between policies: trade and exchange rate policies improved much more than service delivery. Thus, the differing explanations of past slow growth imply different predictions for growth in the coming decade.

We label the latter form a military regime. Both military strongmen and military regimes are more likely to commit human rights abuses and become embroiled in civil wars than are civilian dictatorships. The behavior of strongmen diverges from that of more constrained military rulers in other areas, however. Military strongmen start more international wars than either military regimes or civilian dictators, perhaps because they have more reason to fear postouster exile, prison, or assassination. Fear of the future may also motivate their resistance to transition. Military strongmen are more often ousted by insurgency, popular uprising, or invasion than are military regimes or civilian dictators. Their tenures rarely end in democratization, whereas the opposite is true of military regimes.","2014-05-11","2023-11-13 20:41:45","2023-11-20 00:26:59","2023-11-13 20:41:45","147-162","","1","17","","Annu.

To do this, we have devised a system to locate, download, and analyze the content of millions of social media posts originating from nearly 1,400 different social media services all over China before the Chinese government is able to find, evaluate, and censor (i.e., remove from the Internet) the subset they deem objectionable. Using modern computer-assisted text analytic methods that we adapt to and validate in the Chinese language, we compare the substantive content of posts censored to those not censored over time in each of 85 topic areas. Contrary to previous understandings, posts with negative, even vitriolic, criticism of the state, its leaders, and its policies are not more likely to be censored. Instead, we show that the censorship program is aimed at curtailing collective action by silencing comments that represent, reinforce, or spur social mobilization, regardless of content. Censorship is oriented toward attempting to forestall collective activities that are occurring now or may occur in the future—and, as such, seem to clearly expose government intent.","2013-05","2023-11-13 22:15:51","2023-11-20 00:26:59","2023-11-13 22:15:51","326-343","","2","107","","Am Polit Sci Rev","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/6ATEQRPU/14class student response.pdf; /Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/58MBJPMJ/King et al. - 2013 - How Censorship in China Allows Government Criticis.pdf","","NS3023; State - authoritarian; nondemocratic regimes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Supervisor emotionally intelligent behavior was related to employee affect at work assessed using both open-ended questions and emotion rating scales.

This article revisits the nexus and its related theories, empirically and parsimoniously testing the effects of inequality on disaggregated intrastate conflicts. The results buttress the notion that traditionally deprived identity groups are more likely to engage in conflict under more economically equal conditions, while class or revolutionary wars fall under the conditions of greater economic inequality and war. Of the three types of conflicts tested - ethnic conflicts, revolutions, and genocides - economic inequality seems to have the most ambiguous bearing on genocides. Support follows for recent findings that political and social equalities are of greater importance in mitigating ethnic violence and that greed factors might exacerbate violence in all civil conflicts, including genocides. The theoretical argument proposes that the context within which intrastate violence takes place affects the requisite level of relative resources needed for the escalation of violence between groups. The results have policy implications for ethnically divided states that are in the process of equalizing their income differential, but neglect the substantial inclusion of all groups within the political process and the distribution of public goods. The social contracts between the governors and the governed then require careful crafting for a peaceful coexistence of diverse identity groups.","2005-07","2023-11-27 20:28:13","2023-12-11 20:54:12","2023-11-27 20:28:13","393-415","","4","42","","Journal of Peace Research","Relative Resources","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/EJYSHDHR/17class student response.pdf; /Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/X3ZENXKS/Besançon - 2005 - Relative Resources Inequality in Ethnic Wars, Rev.pdf","","Ethnic Conflict; NS3023; economic policy; intrastate conflict; minorities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Implicit in this view is the belief that organizations are not important in determining the performance of such individuals. In this study, we address this issue by examining skilled individuals who work within multiple organizations roughly simultaneously. Specifically, we consider the performance of cardiac surgeons, many of whom perform operations at multiple hospitals during the course of a given year. Using patient mortality as an outcome measure, we find that the quality of a surgeon's performance at a given hospital improves significantly with increases in his or her annual procedure volume at that hospital but does not significantly improve with increases in his or her volume at other hospitals. Our findings suggest that surgeon performance is not fully portable across hospitals (i.e., some portion of performance is firm specific). We consider the implications of our results for settings beyond health care.","2003-10","2023-11-27 21:37:21","2024-07-04 08:44:40","2023-11-27 21:37:21","w10027","","","","","","","","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","Cambridge, MA","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/QMACBYZN/Huckman and Pisano - 2003 - The Effect of Organizational Context on Individual.pdf","","Leadership - Team Dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","w10027","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its enthusiasts believe global civil society presages a more congenial kind of politics that transcends the system of sovereign states. Its critics deride its unrepresentativeness and complicity in established power relations. The critics can be answered by more subtle accounts of representation and by highlighting contestatory practices. Appreciation of the promise and perils of global civil society requires moving beyond preconceptions rooted in dated ideas about civil society and democracy as they allegedly function within states. Irrespective of the sophistication of such post-Westphalian moves, global civil society remains contested terrain, involving interconnected political and intellectual disputes. International relations theory proves less useful than it should be in clarifying what is at stake. Democratic theory can be brought to bear, and this encounter sheds new light on what democracy itself can entail.","2012-06-15","2023-12-04 20:12:57","2023-12-04 20:13:05","2023-12-04 20:12:57","101-119","","1","15","","Annu.

Tliis article reviews and contrasts systematieally the definitions of 'social movement' formulated by some of the most influential authors in the field. A substantial convergence may be detected between otherwise very different approaches on three points at least. Sociai movements are defined as networks of informal interactions between a plurality of individuals, groups and/or organizations, engaged in political or cultural conflicts, on the basis of shared collective identities. It is argued that the concept is sharp enough a) to differentiate social movements from related concepts such as interest groups, political panies, protest events and coalitions; b) to identify a specific area of investigation and theorising for soeial movement research.","1992-02","2023-12-05 00:01:49","2023-12-19 06:00:38","2023-12-05 00:01:49","1-25","","1","40","","The Sociological Review","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/N4YAH2H9/Diani - 1992 - The Concept of Social Movement.pdf","","social movements; NS3023; 10class","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The charter was established on the foundation of the Helsinki Accords and was further amended in the 1999 Charter for European Security. Together, these documents form the agreed basis for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. However, not all OSCE member countries have signed the treaty. The Charter was one of many attempts to seize the opportunity of the fall of Communism by actively inviting the former Eastern Bloc countries into the ideological framework of the West. It has been compared to the Conference of Versailles of 1919 or the Congress of Vienna of 1815 in its grandiose ambition to reshape Europe[citation needed]. In effect, the Paris Summit was the peace conference of the Cold War: Perestroika had ultimately put an end to the ideological and political division of the Iron Curtain.

Most or all agree that intelligence entails collection, analysis, and counterintelligence, and many add covert action as well. These core functions of intelligence, however, neglect the variety of activities that intelligence services have also engaged in, such as conducting diplomacy, guarding borders, running prisons, operating military units, designing atomic bombs, and managing professional soccer teams. Such peripheral functions can vary across time and place, while the core functions endure but can gradually grow in number over time. Simultaneously, non-intelligence agencies encroach on the turf of intelligence agencies. Thus, ‘intelligence’ is what intelligence agencies do. We close by wondering how these insights can generate testable hypotheses to illuminate patterns in intelligence functions and organizations over time and across a range of regimes.","2018-06-07","2023-12-19 06:53:51","2023-12-19 06:56:08","2023-12-19 06:53:51","517-526","","4","33","","Intelligence and National Security","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/JBGLARNX/Stout and Warner - 2018 - Intelligence is as intelligence does.pdf","","CY4410; intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thereafter, we look at the proliferation of theories that has taken place since the emergence of the third/fourth debate. The coexistence and competition between an ever-greater number of theories begs the question: what kind of theoretical pluralism should IR scholars embrace? We offer a particular account of theoretical engagement that is preferable to the alternatives currently being practised: integrative pluralism. The article ends on a cautiously optimistic note: given the disciplinary competition that now exists in relation to explaining and understanding global social forces, International Relations may find resilience because it has become theory-led, theory-literate and theory-concerned.","2013-09","2023-12-19 21:29:03","2023-12-19 21:59:03","2023-12-19 21:29:03","405-425","","3","19","","European Journal of International Relations","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/YCPAEVKF/Dunne et al. - 2013 - The end of International Relations theory.pdf","","supplemental; 2class - NS & Strat Comp; international relations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"YDNJJ9Y9","videoRecording","2016","CFR Education","Interests vs Values In Foreign Policy | Model Diplomacy","","","","","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn0knKQfLSA","Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass discusses two poles of the U.S. foreign policy debate—values and interests—for “Unrest in Bahrain” and other CFR Model Diplomacy case studies. Values primarily refer to the quality of life within a country’s borders, and interests to matters of economic, security, or diplomatic importance. Interests include such things as investments and regional stability, whereas values include such things as the degree of personal freedom and economic opportunity found within a country. The fault line between the two, Haass says, was evident more than a century ago in the aftermath of World War I when Woodrow Wilson and the United States considered how much to focus on the right of self-determination. Many of the contemporary debates about U.S. foreign policy can also be deconstructed in order to see that one side is arguing for interests and the other side for values, says Haass. He cites U.S. policy toward Egypt as an example of a case where the United States faces a trade-off between promoting interests and values.

However, in focusing primarily on power resources and international activities, existing scholarship on this subject has not adequately addressed how a state obtains and sustains international influence. To overcome this knowledge deficit, this article presents a framework for analyzing international influence that includes not only power resources and influence activities, but also a comprehensive set of power mechanisms that states mobilize to induce change in another state’s behavior. The article applies the framework to US security sector activities in Africa. The analysis, based primarily on interviews with US defense attachés and security cooperation officers, shows how different types of activities mobilize different sets of power mechanisms. It reveals that activities that mobilize expertise, attraction, and recognition mechanisms have the greatest potential for developing and maintaining influence. The article concludes that, to obtain and sustain international influence, states must be more attentive to the mechanisms of power, rather than merely deploying their power resources.","2021-08-11","2023-12-29 01:04:01","2023-12-29 01:04:42","2023-12-29 01:04:01","ogab011","","4","6","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/YBIN2PVT/Meierding and Sigman - 2021 - Understanding the Mechanisms of International Infl.pdf","","Great Power Competition; supplemental; 2class - NS & Strat Comp; international relations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rise of the Chinese and other Asian navies, worsening quarrels over maritime jurisdiction and the United States' maritime pivot towards the Asia-Pacific region reminds us that the sea has always been central to human development as a source of resources, and as a means of transportation, information-exchange and strategic dominion. It has provided the basis for mankind's prosperity and security, and this is even more true in the early 21st century, with the emergence of an increasingly globalized world trading system. Navies have always provided a way of policing, and sometimes exploiting, the system. In contemporary conditions, navies, and other forms of maritime power, are having to adapt, in order to exert the maximum power ashore in the company of others and to expand the range of their interests, activities and responsibilities. While these new tasks are developing fast, traditional ones still predominate. Deterrence remains the first duty of today's navies, backed up by the need to 'fight and win' if necessary. How navies and their states balance these two imperatives will tell us a great deal about our future in this increasingly maritime century. This book investigates the consequences of all this for the developing nature, composition and functions of all the world's significant navies, and provides a guide for anyone interested in the changing and crucial role of seapower in the 21st century. Seapower is essential reading for all students of naval power, maritime security and naval history, and highly recommended for students of strategic studies, international security and International Relations.""--Provided by publisher","2018","2024-01-10 04:32:29","2024-04-01 18:20:21","","","","","","","","Seapower","Cass series","61","","","Routledge","London","en","","","","","BnF ISBN","359.03","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/EM8ZBK4H/Ch3 61-79.pdf; /Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/6LHV3FEC/Ch3 79-105.pdf; /Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/NUPNB6EH/NS4356_Langs_Geoffrey_Till.pptx","","2class; NS4256; maritime strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4th edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"ANRIFLSY","videoRecording","2014","The Economist","What does China want?","","","","","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SscQBrJbiN0","An animated infographic depicting China’s territorial disputes. Is China trying to expand its territory? Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7  ONE reason China’s spectacular rise sometimes alarms its neighbours is that it is not a status quo power. From its inland, western borders to its eastern and southern seaboard, it claims territory it does not control. In the west, China’s border dispute with India is more than a minor cartographic tiff.  China claims an area of India that is three times the size of Switzerland, the state of Arunachal Pradesh. Further west, China occupies Indian claimed territory next to Ladakh in Kashmir, an area called the Aksai Chin. China humiliated India in a brief, bloody war over the dispute in 1962. Since 1988, the two countries have put the dispute on the backburner and got on with developing commercial ties, despite occasional flare-ups. More immediately dangerous is the stand-off between China and Japan over disputed islands in the East China Sea, known as the Senkakus in Japan and Diaoyu in Chinese.  Japan says they have always been its territory and admits no dispute, claiming also that China only started expressing an interest when it began to seem the area might be rich in oil and gas.  A new and much more dangerous phase of the dispute began in 2012 after Japan’s government nationalised three of the islands by buying them from their private owner. China accused Japan of breaking an understanding not to change the islands’ status. Ever since, it has been challenging not just Japan’s claim to sovereignty over the islands, but its claim to control them, sending Chinese ships and planes to patrol them. Raising the stakes is Japan’s alliance with America, which says that though it takes no position on who owns the islands, they are covered by its defence treaty with Japan, since it administers them. Especially provocative to America and Japan was China’s unilateral announcement in November 2013 of an Air-defence Identification Zone, covering the islands.  The worry is less that big powers will deliberately go to war over these desolate little rocks, but that an accidental collision at sea or in the air might escalate unforeseeably. Similar fears cloud disputes in the South China Sea, where the maritime claims in South-East Asia are even more complex, and, again, competition is made more intense by speculation about vast potential wealth in hydrocarbon resources. Vietnam was incensed in May 2014 when China moved a massive oil-rig to drill for two months in what it claimed as its waters. This was near the Paracel Islands, controlled by China since it evicted the former South Vietnamese from them in 1974. To the south, China and Vietnam also claim the Spratly archipelago, as does Taiwan, whose claim in the sea mirrors China’s. But the Philippines also has a substantial claim. Malaysia and even tiny Brunei also have an interest.  But it is with Vietnam and the Philippines that China’s disputes are most active. The Philippines accuses China of salami-slicing tactics, stealthily expanding its presence in disputed waters. In 1995 it evicted the Philippines from Mischief Reef, and in 2012 from Scarborough Shoal. This year it has tried to stop the Philippines from resupplying a small garrison it maintains on the Second Thomas Shoal, and appears to be building an airstrip on the Johnson South Reef. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea—UNCLOS—is one forum for tackling these disputes. But UNCLOS cannot rule over territorial disputes, just over the waters habitable islands are entitled to. And China and Taiwan point to a map published in the 1940s, showing a big U-shaped nine-dashed line around the edge of the sea. That, they say, is historically all China’s. This has no basis in international law, and the Philippines, to China’s fury, is challenging it at an UNCLOS tribunal.  In fact China often fails to clarify whether its claims are based on the nine-dashed line, or on claims to islands, rocks and shoals. That lack of clarity alarms not just its neighbours and rival claimants, but the United States, which says it has its own national interest in the freedom of navigation in a sea through which a huge chunk of global trade passes Also alarming is that if these arguments over tiny specks in the sea become so unmanageable, what hope is there for resolving the really big issues? And the biggest of all is the status of Taiwan, still seen by China as part of its territory, but in practice independent since 1949. For now, Taiwan and China have a thriving commercial relationship. But polls suggest that few in Taiwan hanker after unification with the mainland. And China’s rulers still insist that one day they will have to accept just that.","2014-08-27","2024-01-20 00:07:07","2024-01-20 00:07:33","2024-01-20 00:07:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","YouTube","","","","","","China; Great Power Competition; 2class - NS & Strat Comp; South China Sea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"37XT5RU6","thesis","2009","Eberhart, Paul B","Grand Strategy of the United States: A Study of the Process","","","","","","The thesis of this paper is that the U.S. government must adopt a clearly defined process for developing and articulating grand strategy. This process must include written guidance and definitions to improve the efficacy of the legislative and executive branches’ in the execution of their duties to support a coherent foreign policy. This thesis is about adopting a process for developing and articulating grand strategy. This process is for the decision makers at the highest level of our government. The problem is there is no clearly defined grand strategic formulation, standard, or guidance. By default, the National Security Strategy (NSS), first mandated by the legislature on the executive in the Goldwater-Nichols Act in 1987, became a repository for some basic elements of strategic guidance and thought. There are three primary reasons why adopting a process for a grand strategy is important at this time. The first is the need for clear guidance to reduce inefficiencies. The second is the need to employ the instruments of national power more effectively. Third, the government needs capstone guidance outlining the process, and then it needs a clear example in the form of the GSUS to inform lesser strategic documents. The method used to prove the necessity for adopting a clearly defined process for developing and articulating grand strategy will be a review of literature through a series of chapters highlighting how strategy and grand strategy are defined, how strategic choices are made, and how strategic choices are implemented. Based on this analysis, a model for the formulation of grand strategy presented as a way of guiding policymakers and strategic thinkers in a new post-Cold War environment.","2009-12-06","2024-01-31 22:16:19","2024-03-15 22:18:30","","","77","","","","","","","","","","Joint Forces Staff College","Norfolk, VA","en","","Master's Thesis","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/S5SG8MLW/Eberhart - GRAND STRATEGY OF THE UNITED STATES A Study of th.pdf","","ACSC Material; strategy; supplemental; 3class Warfare Studies; ACSC WAR-601S","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Connelly argues the region, for which it is frequently hard to define exact boundaries and which is sometimes treated country-by-country in a way seemingly separate from the broader trends of European history, was one of shared experience despite most of the peoples being divided by linguistic, geographic, and political barriers. Beginning in the 1780s, an unwitting Habsburg monarch -- Joseph II -- decreed that his subjects would use only German, as he hoped to mold a common nationality using German over the disparate subjects. Instead, he unleashed the energies and struggle for the emergence of new nations that pitted small peoples armed with an idea against empires. The author argues that the underlying national self-assertion which emerged under imperial rule in the eighteen and nineteenth centuries shows deep connections to subsequent histories, to the creation of nation states of the regions after World War I, the failure of democratic rule in these states during the interwar years, the submersion of the region under Nazi then Soviet rule after 1939, and to the reinvention of sovereign states (and then the break up of two of them) after 1989. The book interconnects major themes and country histories for first time, chronicling this diverse region over many generations, from the time of Joseph, through democratic and socialist revolutions, genocide and Stalinism, through civil society movements struggling for liberal democracy, into our own day, when illiberal politicians come to power by exploiting very old fears""-- Provided by publisher","2022","2024-02-01 19:06:15","2024-04-01 18:16:23","","","","","","","","From peoples into nations","","","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton, New Jersey","eng","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 1246626466","","","","Europe; NS3700; Europe - History; Eastern Europe; Yugoslavia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This project compares the relationship between attrition and maneuver warfare. The study considers whether there are times wars of attrition should be fought and whether there are conditions that force wars of attrition. The project employs two case studies to better understand the relationship and the risks of attempting to impose maneuver warfare when the conditions that favor attrition exist. The results of the study indicate four major reasons exist to explain why wars of attrition are common and are sometimes the preferred form of war despite the costs involved. A better understanding of the relationship between wars of attrition and maneuver provides the professional officer with a wider range of options while developing and executing operations. Additionally, leaders must realize that the cost of returning to maneuver may be greater than continuing to fight with an attrition based strategy.","2006-03-15","2024-02-02 23:27:11","2024-03-15 22:18:30","","","24","","","","","","","","","","U.S. Army War College","Carlisle, PA","English","","Straetgy Research Project","","","","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/4KFIUM9M/Springman, The Rapier or The Club_The Relationship Between Attrition and Maneuver Warfare (2006) p 1-20.pdf","","ACSC Material; war; supplemental; 3class Warfare Studies; war - conventional; ACSC WAR-601S","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First developed in the early twentieth century as a way of exploiting the flows of globalization to defend liberal internationalism, their appeal is that they function as an alternative to war. This view, however, ignores the dark paradox at their core: designed to prevent war, economic sanctions are modeled on devastating techniques of warfare. Tracing the use of economic sanctions from the blockades of World War I to the policing of colonial empires and the interwar confrontation with fascism, Nicholas Mulder uses extensive archival research in a political, economic, legal, and military history that reveals how a coercive wartime tool was adopted as an instrument of peacekeeping by the League of Nations.

There has, however, been inadequate attention paid to considerations of jus post bellum in the just war tradition. This essay seeks to contribute to recent efforts to develop jus post bellum principles by ﬁrst noting some of the ways that jus ad bellum and jus in bello considerations serve to constrain what can legitimately be done after war. We argue, however, that the constraints grounded in traditional just war theory do not offer sufﬁcient guidance for judging postwar behavior and that principles grounded in the concept of human rights are needed to complete our understanding of what constitutes a just war. A just peace exists when the human rights of those involved in the war, on both sides, are more secure than they were before the war.","2006-11","2024-02-12 22:39:27","2024-03-15 22:18:30","2024-02-12 22:39:27","309-320","","4","7","","Int Studies Perspectives","Jus Post Bellum","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/D4RMGY3N/Williams and Caldwell - 2006 - Jus Post Bellum Just War Theory and the Principle.pdf","","ACSC Material; required; 3class Warfare Studies; war - closure & stability; ACSC WAR-601S","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While this so-called ‘Eastern Question’ has long featured in diplomatic histories, there has been little attention to how ‘Europe’, as place and idea, may have developed in tandem with the events and dynamics that made up the Eastern Question. This article looks at three major events in the narrative of the Eastern Question to demonstrate how Europeans were – and still are – influenced by their relationship to and role in Ottoman decline, noting how such events produced experiences and values now associated with what, where and why ‘Europe’ is. Indeed, ongoing debates over the accession to the European Union of former Ottoman territories in south-eastern Europe and the Near East clearly exhibit the persistence of language, ideals and forms that were constructed during the era of the Eastern Question.","2014-03","2024-02-13 19:27:39","2024-03-17 02:11:47","2024-02-13 19:27:39","64-80","","1","44","","Journal of European Studies","The Eastern Question as a Europe question","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/XU9CGVM9/Schumacher - 2014 - The Eastern Question as a Europe question Viewing.pdf","","Great Power Competition; 2class; NS3005; Greek War of Independence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From the middle of the nineteenth-century onwards, more than a dozen foreign powers acquired an imperial foothold in China but none secured (and rarely sought) anything more than small pockets of territorial jurisdiction until the Sino-Japanese War of 1937–1945. This chapter considers the fates of three different Chinese empires: the Manchu Qing dynasty, the Western powers, and the Japanese. It will attempt to explain how the Qing vanquished, held, then lost a vast territory marked by pronounced cultural diversity, and explores how its end was closely bound up with the rise and fall of overseas powers in China.","2018-12-06","2024-02-15 00:12:08","2024-02-15 00:13:14","2024-02-15 00:12:07","211-248","","","","","","The Eclipse of Empire in China","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/K3MAYYTL/Ma - 2018 - The Eclipse of Empire in China From the Manchus t.pdf","","China; Great Power Competition; NS3005; 9class","","Thomas, Martin; Thompson, Andrew S.","","","","","Ma, Tehyun","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The theory is advanced by tempering versions of the ‘command of space’, stressing its educational intent, and explaining the nuanced sub-concepts of space control and denial through understanding some precedents set by seapower theory.

Hitler's genocidal ambition may have helped unleash Armageddon, but as McMeekin shows, the war that emerged in Europe in August 1939 was the one Stalin wanted, not Hitler. So, too, was the Pacific war of 1941-1945 the direct result of Stalin's maneuverings, which he orchestrated to unleash the furies of war between capitalist powers Japan and the U.S. This groundbreaking reassessment of the Second World War elucidates Stalin's conquest of most of Eurasia, from Berlin to Beijing, for Communism""--","2021","2024-02-21 18:16:00","2024-02-21 18:22:15","","","831","","","","","Stalin's war","","","","","Basic Books","New York","en","","","","","K10plus ISBN","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/FENW3W7J/McMeekin - 2021 - Stalin's war a new history of World War II.pdf","","Russia - History; 13class; NS3400","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","First edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Motivated by the benefits of real-time distributed information shared between units as well as different levels of command for the purpose of fast and reliable decision-making, numerous nations have been working hard over the past years to implement Network Centric Warfare (NCW). By that, information superiority can be gained and translated into command superiority and finally into force superiority. Being strongly dependent on fast and reliable communication, electrical power outages or disruptions of network nodes like SatCom systems respectively links can have a severe impact on information gathering and in turn on the decision making process and the capacity of forces to act. As a consequence, questions arise about the robustness of the NCW doctrine. The ability of power projection is strongly hampered by anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities. In order to successfully conduct military operations against technologically advanced opponents, forces must address A2/AD as an important element of today’s battle-field, comprehend the associated operational implications, and eliminate any imbalances between military objectives and the means by which to achieve them. Following these considerations, this paper - on a technical level - analyses capabilities and weaknesses of NCW with regard to modern theatres. Based on that, recommendations in order to strengthen the performance and reliability for the further development of NCW are given.","2015-05","2024-02-27 04:46:43","2024-03-15 22:17:25","2024-02-27 04:46:43","169-184","","","","","","Blackout and now?","","","","","IEEE","Tallinn, Estonia","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/UZL8F7E2/Koch and Golling - 2015 - Blackout and now Network Centric Warfare in an an.pdf","","ACSC Material; supplemental; 4class - Air & Space Operations; airpower; Command & Control; Mission Command; ACSC AIR-601S","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 7th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Architectures in Cyberspace (CyCon)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It describes different versions of what signified the end of the Cold War, which include the demolition of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, Mikhail Gorbachev's declaration that the Soviet Union would no longer use its military to subdue the satellite states of the Warsaw Pact in 1988, and the reunification of Germany in October 1990. The chapter also considers the consequences of the end of the Cold War, which include a renewed search for international order and cooperation.","2013-01-28","2024-02-29 04:47:54","2024-03-05 16:13:11","2024-02-29 04:47:54","605-622","","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/DT426TRN/Guyatt - 2013 - The End of the Cold War.pdf","","Great Power Competition; NS3005; 12class; Cold War","","Immerman, Richard H.; Goedde, Petra","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"RGYKUDME","book","2012","","The Oxford Handbook of Capitalism","","978-0-19-539117-6","","","","The financial crisis that began in 2008 and its lingering aftermath have caused many intellectuals and politicians to question the virtues of capitalist systems. The 19 original essays in this handbook, written by leading scholars from Asia, North America, and Europe, analyze both the strengths and weaknesses of capitalist systems. The volume opens with essays on the historical and legal origins of capitalism. These are followed by chapters describing the nature, institutions, and advantages of capitalism: entrepreneurship, innovation, property rights, contracts, capital markets, and the modern corporation. The next set of chapters discusses the problems that can arise in capitalist systems including monopoly, principal agent problems, financial bubbles, excessive managerial compensation, and empire building through wealth-destroying mergers. Two subsequent essays examine in detail the properties of the ""Asian model"" of capitalism as exemplified by Japan and South Korea, and capitalist systems where ownership and control are largely separated as in the United States and United Kingdom. The handbook concludes with an essay on capitalism in the 21st century by Nobel Prize winner Edmund Phelps","2012","2024-03-06 20:52:31","2024-07-04 08:48:08","","","561","","","","","","Oxford handbooks series","","","","Oxford Univ.

"7M7RBIXI","bookSection","2015","Woods, Chris","Birth of a Predator: The Origins of Lethal Drones","Sudden Justice: America's Secret Drone Wars","978-0-19-020259-0","","","","""Sudden Justice explores the secretive history of the United States' use of armed drones and their key role not only on today's battlefields, but also in a covert targeted killing project that has led to the deaths of thousands. Days after 9/11, a CIA Predator in Afghanistan executed the world's first lethal drone strike. The Agency's role was no accident -- it had nurtured and developed drones for almost a decade, seeking a platform from which it could monitor its targets and act lethally and instantly on what was learned. Since then remotely piloted aircraft have played a critical role in America's global counter-terrorism operations and have been deployed to devastating effect in conventional wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. But there is another, covert war -- one in which drones scour the skies of Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia in search of militant and terrorist targets. The American government insists that this secret war is legal. The CIA even claims that its armed drones are ""the most precise weapon ever invented,"" so precise that civilians are no longer killed.

But within less than 90 days, the establishment of the US Space Force would move the entire space enterprise out from under USSTRATCOM to USSPACECOM, and convert ASFPC to the USSF. Accordingly, the CSpOC became USSPACECOM's central global operations center, while doubling as the USSF's 614th AOC.

Deployment of new intercontinental ballistic missiles and the dramatic increase in the number of strategic warheads in the Soviet arsenal created a sense of vulnerability in the United States that was, to a large degree, responsible for the U.S. military buildup of the late 1970s and early 1980s and the escalation of Cold War tensions during that period. U.S. assessments concluded that the Soviet Union was seeking to achieve a capability to fight and win a nuclear war. Estimates of missile accuracy and silo hardness provided by the U.S. intelligence community led many in the United States to conclude that the Soviet Union was building a strategic missile force capable of destroying most U.S. missiles in a counterforce strike and of surviving a subsequent nuclear exchange. Soviet archival documents that have recently become available demonstrate that this conclusion was wrong. The U.S. estimates substantially overestimated the accuracy of the Soviet Union's missiles and the degree of silo reinforcement. As the data demonstrate, the Soviet missile force did not have the capability to launch a successful first strike. Moreover, the data strongly suggest that the Soviet Union never attempted to acquire a first-strike capability, concentrating instead on strategies based on retaliation.","2008-07","2024-04-17 15:54:23","2024-05-06 17:47:42","2024-04-17 15:54:23","118-138","","1","33","","International Security","The Window of Vulnerability That Wasn't","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/U9HTYPVM/Podvig - 2008 - The Window of Vulnerability That Wasn't Soviet Mi.pdf","","Nuclear Weapons; 6class; NS3280","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"S3HY58PT","videoRecording","2014","TomoNews US","Air Force, Marines test MALD missile decoy that can mimic radar signatures of F-16s and B-52s","","","","","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOTu6tavuuA","The U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force announced on Tuesday that they had successfully completed the first flight demonstration of a Miniature Air Launched Decoy Jammer, or MALD-J, with a radio data link at the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, Arizona. The Miniature Air Launched Decoy Jammer, or MALD, program was initiated by the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1995 to develop a low-cost decoy missile that could be fired from a variety of aircraft at a safe standoff distance. A contract for MALD was given to Raytheon in 2002, which manufactures the ADM-160B MALD and ADM-160C MALD-J.  MALD weighs less than 300 pounds and has a range of approximately 500 nautical miles. It can be launched from a range of aircraft, from a B-52 bomber to an F-16 multirole fighter jet. MALD can autonomously fly a pre-planned route and mimic the radar signatures of other aircraft ranging from large strategic bombers to stealth fighters, or even entire formations of bombers or fighter jets, to mislead enemy defence systems. In battle, a single MALD or flight of MALDs can be used to identify and distract enemy defenses, allowing other aircraft to destroy or evade these defenses. A newer version of MALD, the MALD-J, possesses these decoy functions as well as the ability to spoof and jam enemy electronic systems.  MALD-J is equipped with a radio data link and can send situation awareness data to the battle manager, who can use this information to adjust MALD-J’s mission while in flight. ---------------------------------------­-------------------- Welcome to TomoNews, where we animate the most entertaining news on the internets.

IADS like the one Russia has deployed on NATO’s Eastern Flank and which China is creating within the First Island Chain are complex, multilayered defense systems incorporating a range of ground-based and aerial sensors, as well as surface-to-air missile systems. IADS are not in themselves a new phenomenon. However, the SAM systems and radars which make up modern IADS are much more capable than previous generations. The territory which they can cover is also much larger than in previous generations due to several very long-range SAM systems such as the Russian S-400, S-300V4 and Chinese HQ-9.

"X3FJ2874","journalArticle","2019","Mattes, Maj Peter W","Systems of Systems: What, Exactly, is an Integrated Air Defense System?","The MItchell Forum","","","","","When discussing the strategic challenges posed by great power adversaries such as Russia and China the term “integrated air defense system”—otherwise known as an IADS—is often invoked, but done so incorrectly or out of context. It is critical that both U.S. military mission planners and intelligence support personnel have a common and correct understanding of what constitutes an IADS in the modern context to be operationally relevant for any air campaign, much less campaigns against highly capable militaries. This understanding includes the recognition that a linear, simplistic approach to defeating a complex IADS is insufficient, and instead requires truly integrated multi-domain military operations. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the understanding of an IADS and highlight some operational deficiencies that exist due to dated knowledge and understanding of the technological evolution of modern IADS. It is the intent that the reader will understand the key terms and concepts associated with IADS, as well as why tactics such as “IADS rollback,” without multi-domain and multi-effect approaches, are archaic and ineffective against modern systems. Analysts and planners alike must understand that true destruction or denial of singular IADS nodes or mediums of communication may not occur in modern air campaigns. Rather, more realistic effects that seek to disrupt, degrade, or delay the utility of IADS that are simultaneously applied may aggregate together, and give space to allow for the targeting and successful destruction of “centers of gravity” in any future air campaign.","2019-06","2024-04-20 22:50:03","2024-04-22 19:13:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/QTAFVRH8/Mattes - What, Exactly, is an Integrated Air Defense System.pdf","","ACSC Material; required; ACSC AIR-602S; Joint - Air & Space; 7class Air & Space in Joint; Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Q67HUFZF","report","2019","Bonds, Tim; International Security and Defense Policy Center; Rand Corporation","America's strategy-resource mismatch: addressing the gaps between U.S. national strategy and military capacity","","","","","","Significant gaps exist in the ability of the United States and its allies to deter or defeat aggression that could threaten national interests. For example, NATO members Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania remain vulnerable to Russian invasion. South Korea is vulnerable to North Korea's artillery. China's neighbors-especially Taiwan-are vulnerable to coercion and aggression. Violent extremists continue to pose a threat in the Middle East. Solutions to these problems will take both money and time. In this report, RAND researchers analyze the specific technological, doctrinal, and budgetary gaps between the stated strategic and defense policies of the United States and the resources and capabilities that would be required to implement those policies successfully. Absent a change in administration policy or a new political consensus in favor of a defense buildup, there will not be enough resources to close the gap between stated U.S. aims and the military capabilities needed to achieve them. This leaves the Trump administration and this Congress with some difficult choices. The United States could decide to focus primarily on its own security, devoting to allies and partners only those forces and capabilities that could be easily spared. At the other end of the spectrum, the Trump administration could take the central role in defending U.S. allies against aggression by Russia, China, and other potential adversaries. The hard-to-find middle ground would be to provide the military with sufficient capabilities to ensure that aggression that imperils U.S. interests in critical regions would fail while helping allies build the capacity to do more for their own and the collective defense","2019","2024-04-22 21:09:00","2024-04-22 21:25:12","","","","","","","","America's strategy-resource mismatch","","","","","RAND Corporation","Santa Monica, Calif","en","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","MLCM 2022/40436 (U)","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/KTYSFPRR/Bonds - 2019 - America's strategy-resource mismatch addressing t.pdf","","ACSC Material; required; Joint Planning; ACSC JNT-631S","","","","","International Security and Defense Policy Center; Rand Corporation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"RAM4DQ6D","webpage","","","The New Civil-Military Relations in Turkey","Middle East Institute","","","","https://www.mei.edu/publications/new-civil-military-relations-turkey","Following the AKP’s rise in 2002, civil-military relations in Turkey began to change significantly. The military’s tutelage over Turkish politics was gradually replaced with the AKP’s control over the Turkish Armed Forces. The July 2016 coup attempt put an end to the military’s prestige and popularity and ushered in a new era, with Erdoğan and his AKP asserting full civilian control over the military. This paper explores the factors that paved the way for the new civil-military relations between 2002 and 2016, reviews how the 2016 coup attempt became an opportunity for the AKP to further eliminate all opposition, and analyzes the impact of the upcoming 2023 elections and the opposition’s stance on civil-military relations.","","2024-05-02 20:09:12","2024-05-15 20:50:38","2024-05-02 20:09:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/BM9ISJ2Z/Satana - THE NEW CIVIL-MILITARY RELATIONS IN TURKEY.pdf; /Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/BMFF62GE/new-civil-military-relations-turkey.html","","NS4052; 7class; Turkey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The transition to the presidential system in mid-2018 has intensified Turkey’s existing foreign policy problems and given rise to new ones. This paper lays out the evolution of the AKP’s foreign policy, the consequences of the transition to the presidential system, the impact of Erdoğan’s coalition with the nationalists and Eurasianists, and potential pathways forward.","","2024-05-02 20:13:27","2024-05-15 20:50:38","2024-05-02 20:13:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/MTNZHTAC/turkish-foreign-policy-after-presidentialism.html; /Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/7DRRZAMQ/Turkish Foreign Policy After Presidentialism.pdf","","NS4052; 7class; Turkey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"342ZITZN","webpage","","","Religion, Nationalism, and Populism in Turkey Under the AKP","Middle East Institute","","","","https://www.mei.edu/publications/religion-nationalism-and-populism-turkey-under-akp","Over its two decades in power, the AKP has shaped relations between different social groups in Turkey based on religious belonging. It altered people’s perceptions of national identity by making “being a Muslim Turk” more appealing for many at home and abroad, and created new public spaces and collective memories embellished with national heroism sacralized by religious references. Moving beyond Turkey’s oft-cited secular-pious cleavage, this paper aims to shed light on the AKP’s complex relationship with religion through the lens of nationalism, populism, and performance as a means of political mobilization.","","2024-05-02 20:14:35","2024-05-15 20:50:38","2024-05-02 20:14:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/QF9N556F/Religion, Nationalism, and Populism in Turkey Unde.pdf; /Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/5BNL3FB3/religion-nationalism-and-populism-turkey-under-akp.html","","NS4052; 7class; Turkey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This NATO approach advanced cohesion among allies, some of which were politically uncomfortable with if not borderline opposed to nuclear deterrence. Allied comfort is now under siege, however. Russian military doctrine threatens the early use of nuclear weapons, and states such as Iran and North Korea expose fault lines in the nuclear arms control regime that in recent years has sought to further the full abolition of nuclear weapons.

However, what that means in practice depends on the context in which the question is raised. Depending on context, the formal question of what people are due is answered by principles of desert, reciprocity, equality, or need. Justice, therefore, is a constellation of elements that exhibit a degree of integration and unity. Nonetheless, the integrity of justice is limited, in a way that is akin to the integrity of a neighborhood rather than that of a building. A theory of justice offers individuals a map of that neighborhood, within which they can explore just what elements amount to justice","2006","2024-05-08 19:40:16","2024-05-08 19:40:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge","eng","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 70135061","","","","0 MUST OWN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Nuclear Notebook column has been published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists since 1987. This issue examines the status of India’s nuclear arsenal, which includes a stockpile of approximately 160 warheads. India continues to modernize its nuclear arsenal, with at least four new weapon systems now under development to complement or replace existing nuclear-capable aircraft, land-based delivery systems, and sea-based systems. Several of these systems are nearing completion and will soon be combat-ready. India is estimated to have produced enough military plutonium for 140 to 210 nuclear warheads but has likely produced only 160. Nonetheless, additional plutonium will be required to produce warheads for missiles now under development, and India is reportedly building several new plutonium production facilities. India’s nuclear strategy, which has traditionally focused on Pakistan, now appears to place increased emphasis on China, and Beijing is now in range of Indian missiles.","2022-07-04","2024-05-15 16:26:10","2024-05-15 20:51:39","2024-05-15 16:26:10","224-236","","4","78","","Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/TF6HI9ND/Kristensen and Korda - 2022 - Indian nuclear weapons, 2022.pdf","","Nuclear Weapons; 14class; NS3280; South Asia - Nuclear; South Asia; India; India - Nuclear","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many scholars and political figures argue that this decline constitutes compelling evidence of the emergence of a “nuclear taboo” or that the principle of noncombatant immunity has become a deeply held norm. An original survey experiment, recreating the situation that the United States faced in 1945 using a hypothetical U.S. war with Iran today, provides little support for the nuclear taboo thesis. In addition, it suggests that the U.S. public's support for the principle of noncombatant immunity is shallow and easily overcome by the pressures of war. When considering the use of nuclear weapons, the majority of Americans prioritize protecting U.S. troops and achieving American war aims, even when doing so would result in the deliberate killing of millions of foreign noncombatants. A number of individual-level traits—Republican Party identification, older age, and approval of the death penalty for convicted murderers—significantly increase support for using nuclear weapons against Iran. Women are no less willing (and, in some scenarios, more willing) than men to support nuclear weapons use. These findings highlight the limited extent to which the U.S. public has accepted the principles of just war doctrine and suggest that public opinion is unlikely to be a serious constraint on any president contemplating the use of nuclear weapons in the crucible of war.","2017-07","2024-05-22 16:07:42","2024-06-10 20:59:30","2024-05-22 16:07:42","41-79","","1","42","","International Security","Revisiting Hiroshima in Iran","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/IN8USQBU/Sagan and Valentino - 2017 - Revisiting Hiroshima in Iran What Americans Reall.pdf","","Nuclear Weapons; 16class; NS3280; 0 USING; Democracy - Nuclear; nuclear taboo; nuclear - attitudes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The non-use of nuclear weapons since then remains the single most important phenomenon of the nuclear age. Yet we still lack a full understanding of how this tradition arose and is maintained and of its prospects for the future. The widely cited explanation is deterrence, but this account is either wrong or incomplete. Although an element of sheer luck no doubt has played a part in this fortuitous outcome, this article argues that a normative element must be taken into account in explaining why nuclear weapons have not been used since 1945. A normative prohibition on nuclear use has developed in the global system, which, although not (yet) a fully robust norm, has stigmatized nuclear weapons as unacceptable weapons of mass destruction. Without this normative stigma, there might have been more “use.” This article examines this phenomenon in the context of the nuclear experience of the United States.","1999","2024-05-22 16:18:03","2024-05-29 17:31:32","2024-05-22 16:18:03","433-468","","3","53","","Int Org","The Nuclear Taboo","","","","","","","en","https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/D6NTFVMR/Tannenwald - 1999 - The Nuclear Taboo The United States and the Norma.pdf","","Nuclear Weapons; 16class; NS3280; Democracy - Nuclear; nuclear taboo; nuclear - attitudes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The contributors explain how the US military's NC3 works and how it might fail. Concerns about the security of nuclear forces and command and control systems are not new, but they are becoming more urgent. Bringing Cold-War analog systems into the digital age by modernizing hardware and software has the potential to introduce vulnerabilities and unintended consequences. Policymakers and nuclear theorists should consider that nuclear infrastructure and command networks could be penetrated, corrupted, destroyed, or spoofed, leading to a loss of positive control (the ability to fire weapons) or negative control (the ability to prevent unauthorized or accidental use).

Yet nuclear deterrence and cyber operations have quite different political properties. For the most part, nuclear actors can openly advertise their weapons to signal the costs of aggression to potential adversaries, thereby reducing the danger of misperception and war. Cyber actors, in contrast, must typically hide their capabilities, as revelation allows adversaries to patch, reconﬁgure, or otherwise neutralize the threat. Offensive cyber operations are better used than threatened, while the opposite, fortunately, is true for nuclear weapons. When combined, the warﬁghting advantages of cyber operations become dangerous liabilities for nuclear deterrence. Increased uncertainty about the nuclear/cyber balance of power raises the risk of miscalculation during a brinksmanship crisis. We should expect strategic stability in nuclear dyads to be, in part, a function of relative offensive and defensive cyber capacity. To reduce the risk of crisis miscalculation, states should improve rather than degrade mutual understanding of their nuclear deterrents.","2017-02-14","2024-05-22 18:20:34","2024-05-29 17:31:32","2024-05-22 18:20:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/BV9KLMWA/Gartzke and Lindsay - 2017 - Thermonuclear cyberwar.pdf","","Nuclear Weapons; Cyber; 15class; NS3280; Nuclear C3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The nations defense technological and industrial base can now produce various conventional weaponry. Of these, without a doubt, Turkeys drone warfare assets have garnered the utmost attention among the international strategic community. In tandem, the Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) have gradually gained an expeditionary posture with forward deployments across a broad axis, ranging from the Horn of Africa to the Gulf and the Mediterranean. Turkeys proxy warfare capabilities have also registered an uptrend in this respect. Nevertheless, Ankara will have to deal with certain limitations in key segments, particularly 5th generation aircraft and strategic weapon systems which, together, represent a severe intra-war deterrence gap in Turkeys defense posture. The Turkish administration will have to address this specific shortfall given the problematic threat landscape at the nations Middle Eastern doorstep. This study covers two interrelated strategic topics regarding Turkeys national military capacity in the 21st century: its defense technological and industrial base (DTIB) and its military policy, both currently characterized by a burgeoning assertiveness.","2020-09-16","2024-05-30 20:41:06","2024-07-04 08:59:12","2024-05-30 20:41:06","115-130","","Summer 2020","22","","IT","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/Z6RIXG8C/Kasapoğlu - 2020 - Turkey’s Burgeoning Defense Technological and Indu.pdf","","NS4052; 8class; Turkey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the past sixty years, the United Nations has repeatedly attempted to find a bridge between the island’s Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities - but without success. All this has led many observers to increasingly question whether a settlement can be found. So, can Cyprus ever be solved? Hello and welcome! My name is James Ker-Lindsay.

JOIN THE CHANNEL    / jameskerlindsay   The Mediterranean island of Cyprus has become a byword for intractable conflict. Rich in history, the island was settled by Bronze Age Greeks almost 4000 years ago. Since then, it has come under the rule of numerous civilisations - including Egyptians, Romans, Byzantines, Crusaders and the Venetians - before being conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1571. This led to the creation of the Turkish Cypriot community. However, in 1878 the Ottomans handed the island to Britain as part of a defence agreement. While this led to Greek Cypriot calls for union with Greece (enosis), these were repeatedly rejected. In 1955, the Greek Cypriots launched a campaign to end British rule and unite with Greece - a campaign that led to Turkish Cypriots calls for Cyprus to be partitions (taksim). Instead, Greece and Turkey reached a compromise and in 1960 the Republic of Cyprus was created. However, the complex power sharing agreement soon collapsed, which led to the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force, UNFICYP. In 1974 the island was divided when Turkey invaded Cyprus following an attempt by the Greek military government to annex the Island. Since then, efforts to reunite the island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation have continued without success. Today, many ask whether Cyprus is now destined to remain forever divided. Or can Cyprus still be solved?

It argues that since its inception in 2011 it has developed into a (‘comfortable’) quasi-alliance – a less formal and more flexible form of alliance than the traditional ones – driven by profit and threat-related individual and collective motivations. The primary motivations behind the formation of the quasi-alliance have been the common perceptions of Turkey as a security threat and energy-related interests. Moreover, it is suggested that the‘comfortable’and quasi nature of the alliance could allow the three states to manoeuvre politically so as not to exclude future and parallel relations with Turkey. This means that the transformation of the quasi-alliance into a more formal alliance is a rather unlikely scenario and that it could fade out should Turkish‒Israeli relations improve.","2016-09","2024-05-30 20:54:01","2024-07-04 08:59:12","2024-05-30 20:54:01","407-427","","3","21","","Mediterranean Politics","Israel-Cyprus-Greece","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/9UPQTCVN/Tziarras - 2016 - Israel-Cyprus-Greece a ‘Comfortable’ Quasi-Allian.pdf","","NS4052; 11class; Greece; Cyprus; East Mediterranean; Israel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cornerstone of this strategic partnership –which formalises Paris’ and Athens’ geopolitical rapprochement, accelerated after the tensions with Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean in 2020 – lies in a mutual defence clause that commits France and Greece to defend each other in case of an armed attack against their respective territory. The new bilateral alliance thus forged between Athens and Paris, coming on top of similar NATO and EU security guarantees, is of political as well as scholarly interest. Politically, the question is how such an arrangement, which ostensibly aims to protect Greece from fellow NATO member Turkey, squares with the broader European security architecture. From a scholarly perspective, the FrancoGreek defence agreement is remarkable in that, unlike almost all bilateral or minilateral defence cooperation arrangements that have been concluded in recent years between NATO and EU countries, this one touches on the key question of collective defence, thus constituting an intriguing case of “embedded alliance formation”.","2023-10-02","2024-06-17 20:49:50","2024-07-04 08:57:16","2024-06-17 20:49:50","583-606","","4","32","","European Security","A new alliance in Europe","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/TPV9TH7J/Perot - 2023 - A new alliance in Europe the September 2021 defen.pdf","","France; European Union EU; NATO; CSDP; Greece; alliance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Setting aside natural disasters, most of the great catastrophes of human history have been government failures of one sort or another. We argue that many so-called market failures are government failures because government deﬁnes the institutions in which markets succeed or fail. The concept of government failure has been trapped in the cocoon of the theory of perfect markets. Narrowly deﬁned deviations from market perfection have been designated market failures, for which government corrections may or may not really be a solution. Government failure in the contemporary context means failing to resolve a classic market failure. We propose an alternative approach for evaluating whether government fails: the Pareto standard. If an available Pareto improvement is not chosen, or is not implemented, that is a government failure. We organize government failure into two types: substantive and procedural. Substantive failures include the inability or unwillingness to maintain order, to maintain sound ﬁscal and monetary policies, and to reduce risks of transaction costs, which we classify as corruption, agency and rent-seeking. Procedural failures are inadequacies of available social choice mechanisms, causing collective decisions to be arbitrary, capricious, or manipuated. We conclude with some reﬂections on human rationality and the implications of behavioral economics.","2015-07","2024-06-18 17:04:18","2024-06-18 17:05:17","2024-06-18 17:04:18","1-42","","1-2","164","","Public Choice","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/7HS8XS84/Keech and Munger - 2015 - The anatomy of government failure.pdf","","State - failure; market","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the past decade, the Internet has fallen under the control of a tiny group of massive companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook. In Read Write Own, tech visionary Chris Dixon argues that the dream of an open network for fostering creativity and entrepreneurship doesn't have to die, and that in fact it can, and must, be saved with blockchain networks, which he vitally separates from the currency-based speculation that it is unfortunately lumped together with - a distinction he calls ""The Computer vs The Casino"". With lucid and compelling prose - and drawing from his first-hand observations, mental models, and experiences over a 25-year career in the Internet industry - Dixon shows how the Internet has undergone three distinct eras, bringing us to the critical moment we're in today. The first act was the ""read era,"" lasting from 1990 to 2005, in which early Internet networks democratized information.

Either Russian political leaders do not want to comply with the Western credible deterrence posture, or they do not understand what is expected from them. Linguistic factors (e.g., the ‘lost in translation’ effect) affect the effectiveness of the conversation on deterrence between Russia and the West, including NATO. The Russian language does not have one unambiguous equivalent for the Western term “deterrence.” There are several possible translations for deterrence in Russian, including sderzhivaniye, ustrasheniye, sderzhivaniye putem ustrasheniya, sderzhivaniye prinuzhdeniyem, as well as others. These terms are not synonymous, with each having its own different meaning and some being used in Russian military-political theory, where they refer to different concepts. The current study focuses on the most visible linguistic complications in the deterrence dialogue between Russia and the West. Based on the current study, it would often be more reasonable to talk to the Russian political and military elite about containment or coercion, which are more common and have clear, specific meanings in Russian.","2023-11-30","2024-08-28 18:02:08","2025-05-27 19:22:01","2024-08-28 18:02:08","30-47","","2","16","","CJERS","The Linguistic Factor in the Deterrence Conversation between Russia and the West","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/NX6K53DR/Vihmand-Veebel and Veebel - 2023 - The Linguistic Factor in the Deterrence Conversati.pdf","","Russia; Deterrence; 0 MUST READ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Damon is a professional who puts duty, honor, and the men he commands above self interest. Massengale, however, brilliantly advances by making the right connections behind the lines and in Washington's corridors of power. Beginning in the French countryside during the Great War, the conflict between these adversaries solidifies in the isolated garrison life marking peacetime, intensifies in the deadly Pacific jungles of World War II, and reaches its treacherous conclusion in the last major battleground of the Cold War -- Vietnam.

The Three Languages of Politics is an accessible, precise, and insightful guide to lowering the barriers coarsening our politics. This is not a book about one ideology over another.

He addresses current investment fads and critically analyzes cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and meme stocks.

Some European leaders fear a more complete abandonment. Although France remained a treaty ally after Charles de Gaulle’s 1966 announcement, this episode remains the most signiﬁcant rejection of NATO’s organisation in its history. And yet, the potentially fatal crisis catalysed adaptations in the Alliance so successful that they endured through the end of the Cold War. This case offers lessons about institutional endurance in the face of such crisis. NATO adapted boldly, but also prudently; slowly perhaps, but effectively. The high politics of competing national interests and the high stakes of nuclear deterrence demanded change but could not afford catastrophe. How institutions adapt – and by whom – can mean the difference between vanishing and revitalising.","2025-05","2025-05-07 17:41:29","2025-05-07 17:41:50","2025-05-07 17:41:29","246-262","","2","23","","J Mod Eur Hist","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/NB783S4B/Johnston - 2025 - NATO’s ‘Near Death’ and the Study of ‘Vanishing In.pdf","","0 MUST READ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was flawed from the start and thus destined to fail. The spread of liberal democracy around the globe—essential for building that order—faced strong resistance because of nationalism, which emphasizes self-determination. Some targeted states also resisted U.S. efforts to promote liberal democracy for security-related reasons. Additionally, problems arose because a liberal order calls for states to delegate substantial decisionmaking authority to international institutions and to allow refugees and immigrants to move easily across borders. Modern nation-states privilege sovereignty and national identity, however, which guarantees trouble when institutions become powerful and borders porous. Furthermore, the hyperglobalization that is integral to the liberal order creates economic problems among the lower and middle classes within the liberal democracies, fueling a backlash against that order. Finally, the liberal order accelerated China's rise, which helped transform the system from unipolar to multipolar. A liberal international order is possible only in unipolarity. The new multipolar world will feature three realist orders: a thin international order that facilitates cooperation, and two bounded orders—one dominated by China, the other by the United States—poised for waging security competition between them.","2019-04","2025-05-26 10:56:28","2025-05-26 10:57:27","2025-05-26 10:56:28","7-50","","4","43","","International Security","Bound to Fail","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/YI8TJXE5/Mearsheimer - 2019 - Bound to Fail The Rise and Fall of the Liberal In.pdf","","Realism - Structural; 0 MUST READ; international relations; realism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In crosssectional analyses controlling for demographic covariates, cognitive ability, and other Big Five traits, conscientiousness demonstrated beneﬁcial associations of small-to-medium magnitude with all success outcomes. In contrast, other traits demonstrated stronger, but less consistently beneﬁcial, relations with outcomes in the same models. For instance, emotional stability demonstrated medium-to-large associations with life satisfaction and affect but a weak association with income and no association with wealth. Likewise, extraversion demonstrated medium-to-large associations with positive affect and life satisfaction but small-to-medium associations with wealth and (lack of) negative affect and no association with income. Cognitive ability showed small-to-medium associations with income and wealth but no association with any aspect of subjective success. More agreeable adults were worse off in terms of objective success and life satisfaction, demonstrating smallto-medium inverse associations with those outcomes, but they did not differ from less agreeable adults in positive or negative affect. Likewise, openness to experience demonstrated small-to-medium inverse associations with every success outcome except positive affect, in which more open adults were slightly higher. Notably, in each of the ﬁve models predicting objective and subjective success outcomes, individual differences other than conscientiousness explained more variance than did conscientiousness.Thus, the beneﬁts of conscientiousness may be remarkable more for their ubiquity than for their magnitude.","2012","2025-05-27 19:12:14","2025-05-27 19:12:14","2025-05-27 19:12:14","","","","3","","Front.

Regression analyses showed that after controlling for other Big Five traits, all school outcomes were signiﬁcantly predicted by Conscientiousness and ERA, but not Grit. The discussion focuses on the importance of broad personality traits (Conscientiousness; measure of typical performance) and self-regulation abilities (ERA; measure of maximal performance) in predicting school success.","2014-10","2025-05-27 19:12:57","2025-05-27 19:12:57","2025-05-27 19:12:57","29-36","","","52","","Journal of Research in Personality","Predicting school success","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/KWRY8JJT/Ivcevic and Brackett - 2014 - Predicting school success Comparing Conscientious.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Why do some people succeed and others fail? Sharing new insights from her landmark research on grit, MacArthur ""genius"" Angela Duckworth explains why talent is hardly a guarantor of success. Rather, other factors can be even more crucial such as identifying our passions and following through on our commitments. Drawing on her own powerful story as the daughter of a scientist who frequently bemoaned her lack of smarts, Duckworth describes her winding path through teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience, which led to the hypothesis that what really drives success is not ""genius"" but a special blend of passion and long-term perseverance. As a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Duckworth created her own ""character lab"" and set out to test her theory. Here, she takes readers into the field to visit teachers working in some of the toughest schools, cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she's learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers--from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to the cartoon editor of The New Yorker to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll. Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, Grit is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how that--not talent or luck--makes all the difference""--","2018","2025-08-21 17:50:51","2025-08-21 17:51:53","","","349","","","","","Grit","","","","","Scribner","New York London Toronto Sydney New Delhi","eng","","","","","K10plus ISBN","","","","","","0 OWN - Print; 1 AF Prof Reading List","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","First Scribner trade paperback edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Is it time for cheap, uncrewed systems to replace larger, manned platforms? What is the optimal mix of high-end, exquisite systems, and low-end, attritable assets? And how should the Pentagon, NATO, and our other allies invest resources to be best situated for potential conflicts? President Joe Biden’s decision to block Nippon Steel’s planned purchase of U.S. Steel receives not one but two grievances. Chris complains about misinformed reactions to the tragic incidents on New Year’s Eve. Hearty attas to President-elect Donald Trump for suggesting that U.S. allies could build U.S. warships, to the National Security Archive at George Washington University, and to Finland for seizing the Russian ship suspected of cutting undersea cables (and for the Finns’ general seriousness on matters of national defense).&nbsp; &nbsp;","","2025-08-21 18:59:47","2025-08-21 19:03:06","2025-08-21 18:59:47","","","","","","","Net Assessment","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/GVEPNA72/exploring-the-implications-of-precise-mass.html","","1 AF Prof Reading List","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There have been many attempts to understand what makes a good story, but few have used a scientific approach. In The Science of Storytelling, Will Storr applies dazzling psychological research and cutting-edge neuroscience to our myths and archetypes to show how we can tell better stories, revealing, among other things, how storytellers - and also our brains - create worlds by being attuned to moments of unexpected change. Storr's superbly chosen examples range from Harry Potter to Jane Austen to Alice Walker, Greek drama to Russian novels to Native American folk tales, King Lear to Breaking Bad to children's stories. With chapters such as ""The Dramatic Question"" and ""Plot, Endings, and Meaning"" and a practical, step-by-step appendix dedicated to ""The Sacred Flaw Approach"", The Science of Storytelling is destined to become an invaluable resource for writers of all stripes, whether novelist, screenwriter, playwright, or writer of creative or traditional nonfiction","2021","2025-08-21 20:51:46","2025-08-21 20:51:46","","","291","","","","","","","","","","Abrams Press","New York","eng","","","","","K10plus ISBN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose was to ascertain whether faculty could distinguish effective learning practices from ineffective ones, as determined by empirical research in learning science. Faculty responded to items regarding the efficacy of effective practices and others shown by research to be neuromyths or misconceptions. Faculty across all colleges correctly identified most of the effective practices but also endorsed myths/misconceptions, ultimately showing limited pedagogical knowledge. Tenured faculty showed stronger pedagogical knowledge than newer faculty. Faculty were also assessed on their confidence in their knowledge of pedagogical practices. Respondents demonstrated poor metacognitive awareness as there was no relationship between confidence in pedagogical knowledge and actual pedagogical knowledge. Surprisingly, education faculty scored no better in pedagogical knowledge than faculty of any other college and also showed low metacognitive awareness. Results indicate that universities preparing doctoral students for faculty positions should ensure candidates are exposed to accurate information regarding learning science. The implications for colleges of education are more dire in that they may be failing to prepare candidates in the most essential aspects of the field.","2025","2025-09-06 21:31:59","2025-09-06 21:31:59","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/jonathan/Zotero/storage/RHYLUX7X/Cuevas et al. - 2025 - Discerning Myths from Methods University Faculty’.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He helps us understand, in simple terms, the biology of trust and cooperation and why they're essential to our success and fulfillment. Organizations that create environments in which trust and cooperation thrive vastly out perform their competition. And, not coincidentally, their employees love working there. But ""truly human"" cultures don't just happen; they are intentionally created by great leaders. Leaders who, in hard times, would sooner sacrifice their numbers to protect their people, rather than sacrifice people to protect their numbers, are rewarded with deeply loyal teams that consistently contribute their best efforts, ideas and passion. As he did in Start With Why, Sinek illustrates his points with fascinating true stories from many fields.

But Kathryn knew there was little chance she would have turned it down. After all, retirement had made her antsy, and nothing excited her more than a challenge. What she could not have known when she accepted the job, however, was just how dysfunctional her team was, and how team members would challenge her in ways that no one ever had before. In this book, the author turns his keen intellect and storytelling power to the fascinating, complex world of teams. Kathryn Petersen, DecisionTech's CEO, faces the ultimate leadership crisis: uniting a team that is in such disarray that it threatens to bring down the entire company. Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail? The author's story serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight. Throughout the story, he reveals the five dysfunctions that go to the very heart of why teams, even the best ones, often struggle.

Marcus Aurelius wrote the 12 books of the Meditations in Koine Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. It is possible that large portions of the work were written at Sirmium, where he spent much time planning military campaigns from 170 to 180. Some of it was written while he was positioned at Aquincum on campaign in Pannonia, because internal notes tell us that the second book was written when he was campaigning against the Quadi on the river Granova (modern-day Hron) and the third book was written at Carnuntum. It is not clear that he ever intended the writings to be published, so the title Meditations is but one of several commonly assigned to the collection.

At the same time, chatbots powered by generative AI are emerging as a new way to access information, especially with people under 35 – raising concerns about a potential loss of search referral traffic to publisher websites and apps.

In this groundbreaking book, Ray Dalio, one of the greatest investors of our time who anticipated the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2010-12 European debt crisis, shares for the first time his detailed explanation of what he calls the 'Big Debt Cycle.' Understanding this cycle is critical for helping policymakers, investors, and the general public grasp where we are and where we are headed with the debt issue. Dalio's model points toward surprisingly straightforward solutions for dealing with the debt problems that the US, Europe, Japan, and China face today. How Countries Go Broke also shows how these debt problems are related to the other forces--political within countries, geopolitical between countries, natural (droughts, floods, and pandemics), and technological (most importantly, AI)--that together are causing what Dalio calls the ""Overall Big Cycle"" changes in the world order.

Political elites offer policy platforms to voters, and voters adopt those policies - they follow their leaders. Following Their Leaders argues that policies are designed by the elite and the electorate has little say. Preferences for public policy tend to be anchored in a political identity associated with a candidate, party, or ideology; voters' preferences on most issues are derived from their anchor preferences. Holcombe argues that because citizens adopt the policies offered by the elite, democratic institutions are ineffective constraints on the exercise of political power. This volume explores political institutions that help control the elite who exercise political power and discusses the implications political preferences have on democracies","2023","2025-09-27 04:18:01","2025-10-06 14:44:54","","","1","","","","","Following their leaders","Cambridge studies in economics, choice, and society","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge","eng","","","","","K10plus ISBN","","","","","","politics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But how do we write effectively in today's hyper-interactive world? When The Elements of Style and On Writing Well were published in 1959 and 1976, the internet hadn't been invented. Since then, there has been a radical transformation in how we communicate. The average American adult receives over 120 emails and over 100 text messages each day. With all this correspondence, gaining a busy reader's attention is now a competition. Todd Rogers and Jessica Lasky-Fink, both behavioral scientists, offer practical writing advice you can use today. They begin by outlining cognitive facts about how busy people read, then detail six research-backed principles for effective writing: Use fewer words, Lower the reading level, Use formatting judiciously, Make the purpose clear for skimmers, Emphasize value for readers, Make responding as easy as possible Including many examples, a checklist and other tools for the most effective writing, this handbook will make you a more effective communicator. Rogers and Lasky-Fink bring Strunk, White, and Zinsser's core ideas into the 21st century's radically transformed attention marketplace""--","2023","2025-09-27 04:22:23","2025-10-06 14:39:41","","","1","","","","","Writing for Busy Readers","","","","","Penguin Publishing Group","New York","eng","","","","","K10plus ISBN","","","","","","writing","","","","","Lasky-Fink, Jessica","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1st ed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
